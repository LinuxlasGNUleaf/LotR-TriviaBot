# LotR-TriviaBot
This is a discord bot written in Python 3.
It utilizes the Discord, Reddit (and Google in the near future) API.
The bot features mutliple minigames, including:
* **LotR - Trivia Game**
In this game you get asked trivia questions from LotR, the Hobbit, the Silmarillion and the Extended Lore. You have four possible answers. Your score is tracked.
* **LotR - Hangman**
Features the classic hangman game with LotR terms
* **Random Silmarillion quote**
Output a random Silmarillion quote on demand.
* **Reddit meme**
Outputs a dank meme from r/lotrmemes
* **Autoscript feature**
Recognizes lines from the movie script and in the case of a 85% match, completes the sentence and prints the next dialog line
