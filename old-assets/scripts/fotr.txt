GALADRIEL
The world is changed: I feel it in the
water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it
in the air. Much that once was is lost,
for none now live who remember it.

GALADRIEL
It began with the forging of the Great
Rings.

GALADRIEL
Three were given to the Elves, immortal,
wisest and fairest of all beings.

GALADRIEL
Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great miners
and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

GALADRIEL
And Nine, nine rings were gifted to the
race of Men who, above all else, desire
power.

GALADRIEL
For within these rings was bound the
strength and will to govern each race.

GALADRIEL
But they were all of them deceived.

GALADRIEL
for another ring was made.

GALADRIEL
In the land of Mordor, in the fires of
Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring to control all
others.

GALADRIEL
and into this Ring he poured his
cruelty, his malice and his will to
dominate all life.

GALADRIEL
One Ring to rule them all.

GALADRIEL
One by one the Free lands of Middle earth
fell to the power of the Ring.

GALADRIEL
But there were some who resisted.

GALADRIEL
A last alliance of Men and Elves marched
against the armies of Mordor. On the
slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the
freedom of Middle-Earth.

GALADRIEL
Victory was near!

GALADRIEL
But the power of the Ring could not be
undone.

GALADRIEL
It was in this moment, when all hope had
faded, that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

GALADRIEL
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of
Middle-Earth, was defeated.

GALADRIEL
The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this
one chance to destroy evil forever.

GALADRIEL
But the hearts of Men are easily
corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a
will of its own.

GALADRIEL
It betrayed Isildur to his death.

GALADRIEL
And some things that should not have been
forgotten, were lost.

GALADRIEL
History became legend, legend became
myth.

GALADRIEL
And for two and a half thousand years the
Ring passed out of all knowledge.

GALADRIEL
Until, when chance came, it ensnared a
new bearer!

GOLLUM
My Precious.

GALADRIEL
The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who
took it deep into the tunnels of the
Misty Mountains.

GALADRIEL
And there, it consumed him.

GOLLUM
It came to me. My own. My love,
my preciousness.

GALADRIEL
The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long
life. For five hundred years it poisoned
his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's
cave, it waited.

GALADRIEL
Darkness crept back into the forests of
the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the
East. Whispers of a nameless fear. And
the Ring of Power perceived its time
had now come. It abandoned Gollum.

GALADRIEL
But something happened then the Ring did
not intend.

GALADRIEL
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

BILBO
What's this?

GALADRIEL
A Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

BILBO
A Ring!

GOLLUM
Lost! Lost! My Precious is lost!

GALADRIEL
For the time will soon come when Hobbits
will shape the fortunes of all.

STOP

BILBO
The 22nd day of September in the year
1400 by Shire-reckoning. Bag End, Bagshot
Row, Hobbiton, Westfarthing, the Shire,
Middleearth. The Third Age of this world.

BILBO
There and Back Again: A Hobbit’s Tale by
Bilbo Baggins.

BILBO
Now, where to begin? Ah yes:
"Concerning Hobbits."

BILBO
"Hobbits have been living and farming in
the four Farthings of the Shire for many
hundreds of years, quite content to
ignore and be ignored by the world of the
Big Folk. Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count,
Hobbits must seem of little importance
being neither renowned as great warriors
nor counted among the very wise."

BILBO
Frodo! Someone at the door.

BILBO
"In fact, it has been remarked by some
that Hobbits’ only real passion is for
food."

BILBO
"A rather unfair observation as we
have also developed a keen interest
in the brewing of ales-"

BILBO
"and the smoking of pipe-weed."

BILBO
"But where our hearts truly lie is in
peace and quiet and good, tilled earth."

BILBO
"For all Hobbits share a love of things
that grow."

BILBO
"And, yes, no doubt to others, our days,
it is brought home to me: It is no bad
thing to celebrate a simple life."

BILBO
Frodo, the door!

BILBO
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

BILBO
Frodo!

STOP

FRODO
You're late.

GANDALF
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,
nor is he early. He arrives precisely
when he means to.

FRODO
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

GANDALF
You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle
Bilbo's birthday?

GANDALF
So, how is the old rascal?
I hear it's going to be
a party of special magnificence.

FRODO
You know Bilbo. He's got the whole place
in an uproar.

GANDALF
Oh, well. That should please him.

FRODO
Half the Shire's been invited. And the
rest of them are turning up anyway.

BILBO
And so life in the Shire goes on very
much as it has this past age full of its
own comings and goings, with change
coming slowly-

BILBO
if it comes at all. For things are
made to endure in the Shire passing from
one generation to the next.

BILBO
There’s always been a Baggins living
here under the Hill in Bag End.

BILBO
And there always will be.

FRODO
To tell you the truth, Bilbo’s been a
bit odd lately. I mean, more than usual.
He’s taken to locking himself in his
study.

FRODO
He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I’m not looking.

FRODO
He's up to something.

GANDALF
Oh, really?

FRODO
Alright then. Keep your secrets. Before
you came along, we Bagginses were very
well thought of.

GANDALF
Indeed?

FRODO
Never had any adventures or did anything
unexpected.

GANDALF
If you're referring to the incident with
the dragon, I was barely involved. All
I did was give your uncle a little nudge
out the door.

FRODO
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labelled a disturber of the Peace.

STOP

FRODO
Gandalf, I'm glad you're back.

GANDALF
So am I, dear boy. So am I.

STOP

BILBO
No thank you! We don't want any more
visitors, well-wishers, or distant
relations!

GANDALF
And what about very old friends?

BILBO
Gandalf?

GANDALF
Bilbo Baggins!

BILBO
My dear Gandalf!

GANDALF
Good to see you. One hundred and eleven
years old, who would believe it?

GANDALF
You haven't aged a day!

BILBO
Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome!

STOP

BILBO
Tea? Or maybe something stronger? I've
a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,
1296. A very good year, almost as old as
I am. It was laid down by my father. What
say we open one, eh?

GANDALF
Just tea, thank you.

BILBO
I was expecting you some time last week.
Not that it matters, you come and go as
you please, always have done, always
will. You’ve caught me a bit unprepared, I’m
afraid. We’ve only got cold chicken, bit
of pickle. There's some cheese here.
No that won't do.

BILBO
Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
tart. Got some custard somewhere. Not
much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh
no, we're alright! I've just found some
sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope
it's enough. I could make you some eggs
if you like?

GANDALF
Just tea, thank you.

BILBO
Oh, right. You don't mind if I eat, do you?

GANDALF
No, not at all. Go ahead.

STOP

MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS
Bilbo Baggins, you open this door! I know you're in there.

BILBO
I'm not home.

BILBO
It’s the Sackville-Bagginses!

LOBELIA
I know you’re in there!

BILBO
They’re after the house. They’ve never
forgiven me for living this long!

BILBO
I’ve got to get away from these
confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
all day, never giving me a moment's
peace. I want to see mountains
again. Mountains, Gandalf! And then
find somewhere quiet where I can finish
my book. Oh, Tea!

GANDALF
So, you mean to go through with your
plan, then?

BILBO
Yes, yes, it's all inhand. All the
arrangements are made.

GANDALF
Frodo suspects something.

BILBO
'Course he does, he's a Baggins! Not
some blockheaded Bracegirdle from
Hardbottle!

GANDALF
You will tell him, won't you?

BILBO
Yes, yes.

GANDALF
He's very fond of you.

BILBO
I know. He'd probably come with me if I
asked him. I think, in his heart,
Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the
woods and the fields, little rivers.

BILBO
I am old, Gandalf.

BILBO
I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning
to feel it in my heart.

BILBO
I feel thin, sort of stretched, like
butter scraped over too much bread. I
need a holiday. A very long holiday and
I don't expect I shall return. In fact,
I mean not to.

STOP

BILBO
Old Toby, the finest weed in
Southfarthing!

BILBO
Ohhhh, Gandalf my old friend, this will be a
night to remember!

STOP

BILBO
Hello, hello, Fatty Bolger, lovely to
see you! Welcome, welcome!

STOP

FRODO
Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.

SAM
I think I'll just have myself another
ale.

FRODO
Oh, no you don't. Go on.

STOP

BILBO
So, there I was, at the mercy of three
monstrous trolls. Have you ever heard of
a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?
Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly
things. And they're arguing, arguing
about how they were going to cook us!

BILBO
Whether it be turned on a spit or minced
in a pie or whether they were going to
sit on us one by one and squash us into
jelly! But they spent so long arguing
the whether-to's and why-for's that the
sun's first light crept over the top of
the trees. And turned them all to stone!

STOP

MERRY
No, no the big one the big one!

BILBO
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you!
Welcome, welcome. Are all these children
yours?

BILBO
Good gracious, you have been productive.

LOBELIA
Bilbo?

BILBO
Sackville-Bagginses! Quickly! Hide!

BILBO
Thank you, my boy.
You're a good lad, Frodo.

BILBO
I'm very selfish, you know. Yes, I am
very selfish. I don't know why I took
you in after your mother and father died,
but it wasn't out of charity. I think it
was because, of all my numerous relations
you were the one Baggins that showed real
spirit.

FRODO
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's
home brew?

BILBO
No. Well, yes. But that's not the point.
The point is Frodo- 

BILBO
You'll be alright.

STOP

MERRY
You're supposed to stick it in the
ground!

PIPPIN
It is in the ground.

MERRY
Outside!

PIPPIN
This was your idea!

FRODO
Bilbo! Watch out for the dragon!

BILBO
Dragon? Nonsense! Hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years!

MERRY
That was good!

PIPPIN
Let's get another one!

GANDALF
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.
I might have known!

STOP

FRODO
Speech!

BILBO
My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, Tooks and
Brandybucks, Grubbs, Chubbs,
Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and
Proudfoots.

ODO PROUDFOOT
Proudfeet!

BILBO
Today is my one hundred and eleventh
birthday! But alas, eleventy- one
years is far too short a time to live
among such excellent and admirable
Hobbits!

BILBO
I don't know half of you half as well as
I should like, and I like less than half
of you as well as you deserve.

BILBO
I have things to do and I have put this
off for far too long.

BILBO
I regret to announce this is the end. I
am going now. I bid you all a very fond
farewell!

BILBO
Goodbye.

STOP

GANDALF
I suppose you think that was terribly
clever?

BILBO
Come on, Gandalf! Did you see their
faces?

GANDALF
There are many magic rings in this world,
Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be
used lightly.

BILBO
It was just a bit of fun! Oh, you're
probably right, as usual.

GANDALF
You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

GANDALF
Two eyes. As often as I can spare them.

BILBO
I'm leaving everything to him.

GANDALF
What about this ring of yours? Is that
staying too?

BILBO
Yes, yes, it's in an envelope, over
there on the mantelpiece.

BILBO
No, wait. It's here in my pocket.
Isn't that odd now? Yet, after
all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?

GANDALF
I think you should leave the Ring behind,
Bilbo. Is that so hard?

BILBO
Well, no, and yes. Now that it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it. It's
mine. I found it. It came to me!

GANDALF
There's no need to get angry.

BILBO
Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's
mine. My own, my precious.

GANDALF
Precious? It's been called that before,
but not by you.

BILBO
So? What business is it of yours what I
do with my own things?

GANDALF
I think you've had that ring quite long
enough.

BILBO
You want it for yourself!

GANDALF
Bilbo Baggins, do not take me for some
conjurer of cheap tricks!
I am not trying to rob you. I am trying
to help you.

GANDALF
All you long years we've been
friends. Trust me as you once did. Let
it go!

BILBO
You're right, Gandalf, the Ring must go
to Frodo.

BILBO
It's late, the road is long. Yes, it is
time.

GANDALF
Bilbo?

BILBO
Hmmm?

GANDALF
The Ring is still in your pocket.

BILBO
Oh, yes.

BILBO
I've thought up and ending for my
book: "And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

GANDALF
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

BILBO
Goodbye, Gandalf.

GANDALF
Goodbye ,dear Bilbo.

GANDALF
Until our next meeting.

STOP

GANDALF
Riddles in the dark.

FRODO
Bilbo! Bilbo!

FRODO
He's gone, hasn't he?

FRODO
He talked for so long about leaving.
I didn't think he'd really do it.

FRODO
Gandalf?

GANDALF
Bilbo's ring.
He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's
left you Bag End, along with all his possessions.

GANDALF
The Ring is yours now. Put it somewhere
out of sight.

FRODO
Where are you going?

GANDALF
I have some things I must see to.

FRODO
What things?

GANDALF
Questions. Questions that need
answering.

FRODO
You've only just arrived! I don't
understand!

GANDALF
Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it
safe.

STOP

GOLLUM
Shire! Baggins!

STOP

GANDALF
The year 3434 of the Second Age here
follows the account of Isildur, High King
of Gondor, and the finding of the Ring of
Power.

GANDALF
It has come to me, the Ring of Power! It
shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate, for I will
risk no hurt to the Ring. It is precious
to me, though I buy it with great pain.

GANDALF
The markings upon the band begin to fade;
the writing, which at first was as
clear as red flame, has all but
disappeared. A secret now that only fire
can tell. 

STOP

BLACK RIDER
Shire? Baggins?

FARMER MAGGOT
There's no Bagginses around here! They
are all up in Hobbiton, that way!

STOP

HOBBITS
Hey ho, to the bottle I go! To heal my
heart and drown my woe. Rain may fall and
wind may blow. But there still be many
miles to go! Sweet is the sound of the
pouring rain, and the stream that falls
from hill to plain. Better than rain or
rippling brook–

PIPPIN
is a mug of beer inside this Took!

DADDY TWOFOOT
There's been some strange folk crossing
the Shire. Dwarves and others of less than
a savory nature.

TED SANDYMAN
War is brewing. The mountains are fair
teeming with Goblins.

GAFFER
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is. You're beginning to
sound like that old Bilbo Baggins.
Cracked, he was.

TED SANDYMAN
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking!

FRODO
And proud of it. Cheers, Gaffer.

GAFFER
Well, it's none of our concern what goes
on beyond our borders. Keep your nose out
of trouble, and no trouble'll come to
you.

STOP

ROSIE
Goodnight, lads.

INTOXICATED HOBBIT
Goodnight, sweet maiden of the
golden ale!

SAM
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

FRODO
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

SAM
Does she?

STOP

GANDALF
Is it secret? Is it safe?

FRODO
What are you doing?

GANDALF
Hold out your hand, Frodo. It is quite
cool.

GANDALF
What can you see? Can you see anything?

FRODO
Nothing, there's nothing. Wait.
There are markings.

FRODO
It's some form of Elvish, I can't read
it.

GANDALF
There are few who can. The language is
that of Mordor, which I will not utter
here.

FRODO
Mordor!

GANDALF
In the common tongue it says, "One ring to rule them all, One
ring to find them, One ring to bring them all, and in the
darkness bind them."

GANDALF
This is the one ring forged by the dark
lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mount
Doom. Taken by Isildur from the hand of
Sauron himself.

FRODO
Bilbo found it in Gollom's cave.

GANDALF
For sixty years the Ring lay quiet in
Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life,
delaying old age, but no longer Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor. The Ring has
awoken. It has heard its master's call.

FRODO
But he was destroyed. Sauron was
destroyed.

GANDALF
No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron
endured. His life force is bound to the
ring and the Ring survived. Sauron has
returned. His Orcs have multiplied. His
fortress of Barad-dur is rebuilt in the
land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this
ring to cover all the lands in the second
darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it,
all his thought is bent on it. For the
ring yearns, above all else, to return to
the hand of its master: They are one, the
ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must
never find out.

FRODO
Alright!
We put it away, we keep it hidden! We
never speak of it again. No one know
it's here, do they?

FRODO
Do they, Gandalf?

GANDALF
There is one other who knew that Bilbo
had the Ring. I looked everywhere for
the creature Gollum, but the enemy found
him first.

GANDALF
I don't know how long they tortured
him, but amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words.

GOLLUM
Shire! Baggins!

FRODO
Shire! Baggins! That will lead them
here!

FRODO
Take it! Take it!

GANDALF
No, Frodo.

FRODO
You must take it.

GANDALF
You cannot offer me this ring.

FRODO
I'm giving it to you!

GANDALF
Don't tempt me, Frodo. I dare not take
it, not even to keep it safe.

GANDALF
Understand, Frodo! I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good. But through
me, it would wield a power too great and
terrible to imagine.

FRODO
But it cannot stay in the Shire!

GANDALF
No, no it can't.

FRODO
What must I do?

GANDALF
You must leave, and leave quickly. Get
out of the Shire.

FRODO
Where? Where shall I go?

GANDALF
Make for the village of Bree.

FRODO
Bree? What about you?

GANDALF
I will be waiting for you at the Inn of
the Prancing Pony.

FRODO
And the Ring will be safe there?

GANDALF
I don't know, Frodo. I don't have any
answers. I must see the Head of my
Order. He is both wise and powerful.
Trust me, Frodo. He'll know what to go.

GANDALF
You'll have to leave the name of Baggins
behind you, for that name is not safe
outside the Shire.

GANDALF
Travel only by day and stay off the road.

FRODO
I can cut across country easily enough.

GANDALF
My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing
creatures. You can learn all there
is to know about their ways in a month,
and yet, after a hundred years, they can
still surprise you.

GANDALF
Get down!

GANDALF
Confound it all! Samwise Gamgee, have
you been eavesdropping?

SAM
I ain't been dropping no eaves, sir!
Honest. I was just cutting the grass
under the window there, if you follow
me.

GANDALF
It's a little late for trimming the
hedges, don't you think?

SAM
I heard raised voices-

GANDALF
What did you hear? Speak!

SAM
Nothing important. That is, I heard a
good deal about a ring and a Dark Lord.
And something about the end of the world.
But please, Mister Gandalf, sir, don't
hurt me! Don't turn me into anything
unnatural!

GANDALF
No?

GANDALF
Perhaps not. I've thought of a better
use for you.

STOP

GANDALF
Come along, Samwise, keep up!

GANDALF
Be careful, both of you. The Enemy has
many spies in his service, many ways of
hearing: Birds and beasts.

GANDALF
Is it safe?

GANDALF
Never put it on, for then the agents of
the Dark Lord will be drawn to its
power. Always remember, Frodo, the Ring
is trying to get back to its master. It
wants to be found.

STOP

SAM
This is it.

FRODO
This is what?

SAM
If I take one more step it'll be the
farthest away from home I've ever been.

FRODO
Come on, Sam.

FRODO
Remember what Bilbo used to say:
It's a dangerous business, Frodo,
going out your door. You step onto the
road, and if you don't keep your feet,
there's not knowing where you might be
swept off to.

STOP

FRODO
Sam! Wood-Elves!

ELVEN VOICES
O Light to us that wander here
Amid the world of woven trees!
O Elbereth Gilthoniel!
Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath!

FRODO
They're going to the harbour beyond
the White Towers. To the Grey Havens.

SAM
They're leaving Middle-earth.

FRODO
Never to return.

SAM
I don't know why, it makes me sad.

STOP

SAM
Everywhere I lie there’s a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

FRODO
Just shut your eyes, and imagine
you're back in your own bed, with a
soft mattress and a lovely feather
pillow.

SAM
It's not working Mr. Frodo. I'm never
going to be able to sleep out here.

FRODO
Me neither, Sam.


SARUMAN
Smoke rises once more from the mountain
of doom. The shadow takes shape in the
darkness of Mordor. The hour grows
late, and Gandalf the Grey rides to
Isengard seeking my counsel.

SARUMAN
For that is why you have come, is it not,
my old friend?

GANDALF
Saruman!

STOP

SARUMAN
Are you sure of this?

GANDALF
Beyond any doubt.

SARUMAN
So the Ring of Power has been found?

GANDALF
All these long years it was in the Shire,
under my very nose.

SARUMAN
And yet you did not have the wit to see
it! Your love of the Halfling's leaf has
clearly slowed your mind.

GANDALF
We still have time, time enough to
counter Sauron if we act quickly.

SARUMAN
Time? What time do you think we have?

SARUMAN
Sauron has regained much of his former
strength. He cannot yet take physical
form, but his spirit has lost none of
its potency. Concealed within his
fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all.
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth,
and flesh. You know of what I speak,
Gandalf. A great Eye, lidless, wreathed
in flame.

GANDALF
The Eye of Sauron.

SARUMAN
He is gathering all evil to him.
Very soon he will have summoned an army
great enough to launch an assault upon
Middle earth.

GANDALF
You know this? How?

SARUMAN
I have seen it.

GANDALF
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

SARUMAN
Why? Why should we fear to use it?

GANDALF
They are not all accounted for, the lost
seeing-stones. We do not know who else
may be watching.

SARUMAN
The hour is later than you think.
Sauron's forces are already moving. The
Nine have left Minas Morgul.

GANDALF
The Nine!

SARUMAN
They crossed the river Isen on
Midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in
black.

GANDALF
They have reached the Shire?

SARUMAN
They will find the Ring, and kill the
one who carries it.

SARUMAN
You did not seriously think a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?
There are none who can.

SARUMAN
Against the power of Mordor, there can be
no victory. We must join with him,
Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It
would be wise, my friend.

GANDALF
Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the
wise abandon reason for madness?

SARUMAN
I gave you the chance of aiding me
willingly, but you have elected the way
of pain!

STOP

SAM
Mister Frodo. Mister Frodo!

SAM
I thought I lost you.

FRODO
What are you talking about?

SAM
It's just something Gandalf said.

FRODO
What did he say?

SAM
He said: "Don't you leave him, Samwise
Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

FRODO
Sam, we're still in the Shire. What
could possibly happen?

PIPPIN
Frodo! Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.

MERRY
Hello Frodo!

SAM
What's the meaning of this?

MERRY
Sam, hold this.

SAM
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

FARMER MAGGOT
Who's that in my field! Get out of it!
Get out of my field, you young varmits!
I'll show you! Get out of my corn!

MERRY
I don't know why he's so upset, it's only
a couple of carrots.

PIPPIN
And some cabbages! And those three bags
of potatoes that we lifted last week.
And then the mushrooms the week before.

MERRY
Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly
overreacting.

PIPPIN
Run!

STOP

PIPPIN
That was close.

MERRY
Ow! I think I've broken something.

SAM
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

MERRY
What? That was just a detour.
A shortcut!

SAM
A shortcut to what?

PIPPIN
Mushrooms!

FRODO
I think we should get off the road.

FRODO
Get off the road!

STOP

MERRY
What was that?

PIPPIN
What is going on?

MERRY
The Black rider was looking for
something. Or someone. Frodo?

SAM
Get down!

FRODO
I have to leave the Shire. Sam and I
must get to Bree.

MERRY
Right. Buckleberry Ferry. Follow me !

MERRY
There's another one! Frodo, this way!

MERRY
Frodo, follow me!

MERRY
Get the ropes, Sam.

SAM
Frodo!

FRODO
How far to the nearest crossing?

MERRY
The brandwine bridge. Twenty miles.

STOP

FRODO
Come on.

OLD HARRY
What do you want?

FRODO
We're headed for the prancing pony.

OLD HARRY
Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what's more,
out of the Shire by your talk. What
business brings you to Bree?

FRODO
We wish to stay at the inn. Our business
is our own.

OLD HARRY
All right, young sir, I meant no offense.

OLD HARRY
It's my job to ask questions after
nightfall. There's talk of strange fold
abroad. Can't be too careful.

STOP

FRODO
Excuse me.

BUTTERBUR
Good evening, little masters. If you're
seeking accommodation, we've got some
nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms available,
Mister- ?

FRODO
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

BUTTERBUR
Underhill? Hmmmm.

FRODO
We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can
you tell him we've arrived?

BUTTERBUR
Gandalf, Gandalf. Oh.
Oh yes! I remember! Elderly chap, big
grey beard, pointy hat?

BUTTERBUR
Not seen him for six months.

SAM
What do we do now?

FRODO
Sam, he'll be here. He'll come.

PIPPIN
What's that?

MERRY
This, my friend, is a pint.

PIPPIN
It comes in pints? I'm getting one!

SAM
You've got a whole half already!

SAM
That fellow's done nothing but stare at
you since we've arrived.

FRODO
Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is
he?

BUTTERBUR
He's one of them Rangers; they're
dangerous folk they are, wandering the
wilds. What his right name is, I never
heard, but round here he's known as
Strider.

FRODO
Strider.

PIPPIN
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins! He's
over there!

Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side
and my third cousin, twice removed on
his father's side, if you follow me.

FRODO
Pippin!

PIPPIN
Steady on, Frodo!

VOICE OF SAURON
You cannot hide. I see you.
There is no life here in the void.
Only cold, only death.

STRIDER
You draw far too much attention to
yourself, Mister Underhill.

FRODO
What do you want?

STRIDER
A little more caution from you, that is
no trinket you carry.

FRODO
I carry nothing.

STRIDER
Indeed? I can usually avoid being seen
if I wish, but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

FRODO
Who are you?

STRIDER
Are you frightened?

FRODO
Yes.

STRIDER
Not nearly frightened enough. I know
what hunts you.

SAM
Let him go or I'll have you, Longshanks!

STRIDER
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit,
but that alone will not save you. You can
no longer wait for the Wizard, Frodo.
They're coming.

STOP

FRODO
What are they?

STRIDER
They were once men.

STRIDER
Great Kings of men. Then Sauron the
deceiver gave to them Nine Rings of
Power. Blinded by their greed they took
them without question, one by one falling
into darkness. Now they are slaves to
his will.

STRIDER
They are the Nazgul, Ringwraiths, neither
living or dead. At all times they feel
the presence of the Ring, drawn to the
power of the one. They will never stop
hunting you.

STOP

FRODO
Where are you taking us?

STRIDER
Into the wild.

MERRY
How do we know this Strider is a friend
of Gandalf?

FRODO
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer and feel fouler.

FRODO
We have no choice but to trust him.

SAM
But where is he leading us?

STRIDER
To Rivendell, Master Gamgee. To the
house of Elrond.

SAM
Did you hear that, Bill? Rivendell!
We're going to see the Elves!

STOP

STRIDER
Gentlemen, we do not stop until
nightfall.

PIPPIN
What about breakfast?

STRIDER
You've already had it.

PIPPIN
We've had one, yes. But what about
second breakfast?

MERRY
I don't think he knows about second
breakfast, Pip.

PIPPIN
What about Elvenses, Luncheon, Afternoon
Tea, dinner? He knows about them,
doesn't he?

MERRY
I wouldn't count on it.

STOP

MERRY
What do they eat when they can’t
get Hobbit?

STRIDER
Immortal maiden elven-wise,
About him cast her night-dark hair,
And arms like silver glimmering.

FRODO
Who is she? This woman you sing of?

STRIDER
‘Tis the lady of Lúthien. The
Elf-maiden who gave her love to
Beren, a mortal.

FRODO
What happened to her?

STRIDER
She died.
Get some sleep, Frodo.

STOP

SARUMAN
The power of Isengard is at your command,
Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

SAURONS VOICE
Build me an army worth of Mordor.

ORC OVERSEER
What orders from Mordor, my Lord. What
does the eye command?

SARUMAN
We have work to do.

STOP

ORC OVERSEER
The trees are strong, my Lord. Their
roots go deep.

SARUMAN
Rip them all down.

STOP

STRIDER
This was once the great Watchtower of
Amon Sûl. We shall rest here tonight.

STRIDER
These are for you. Keep them close. I'm
going to have a look around. Stay here.

STOP

FRODO
What are you doing?

MERRY
Tomatoes, sausages, and crispy bacon.

SAM
We saved some for you, Mister Frodo.

FRODO
Put it out, you fools! Put it out!

PIPPIN
Oh, that's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

FRODO
Go!

STOP

SAM
Mister Frodo!
Help him, Strider!

STRIDER
He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

SAM
Do something.

STRIDER
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

STRIDER
Hurry!

SAM
We are six days from Rivendell.

STRIDER
Hold on, Frodo.

SAM
He'll never make it!

FRODO
Gandalf? Gandalf?

STOP

PIPPIN
Is he going to die?

STRIDER
No. He is passing into the shadow world,
he will soon become a wraith like them.

MERRY
They're close.

STRIDER
Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

SAM
Athelas?

STRIDER
Kingsfoil.

SAM
Kingsfoil. Aye. It's a weed.

STRIDER
It may help to slow the poison. Hurry!

STOP

ARWEN
What is this? A Ranger caught off his
guard?

STOP

ARWEN
Frodo, Im Arwen. Telin let thaed. I am
Arwen, I have come here to help you.
Lasto beth nîn. Tolo dan na ngalad.
Hear my voice, come back to the light.

PIPPIN
Who is she?

ARWEN
Frodo?

SAM
She's an elf.

ARWEN
He's fading, he's not going to last. We
must get him to my father.

PIPPIN
Where are you taking him?

ARWEN
I've been looking for you for two days.
There are five Wraiths behind you, where
the other four are, I do not know.

STRIDER
Stay with the hobbits. I'll
send horses for you.

ARWEN
I am the faster rider. I'll take him.

STRIDER
The road is too dangerous.

ARWEN
If I can cross the river, the
power of my people can protect him.

PIPPIN
What are they saying?

ARWEN
I do not fear them.

STRIDER
Arwen, ride hard. Don't look back.

ARWEN
Noro lim, Asfaloth, noro lim!

SAM
What are you doing! Those Wraiths are
still out there!

STOP

WITCH KING
Give up the halfling, she-elf!

ARWEN
If you want him, come and claim him.

ARWEN
Chithaeglir, nin Bruinen,
Chithaeglir, nin Bruinen,

lasto beth daer, dan in Ulair!
Waters of the Misty Mountains,
listen to the great word:
flow waters of Loudwater,
against the Ringwraiths!

STOP

ARWEN
No, no Frodo, no! Frodo, don't give
in! Not now!

ARWEN
What grace is given me, let it pass to
him. Let him be spared. Save him.

STOP

FRODO
Where am I?

GANDALF
You are in the House of Elrond, and it is
ten o'clock in the morning on October the
twenty-fourth, if you want to know.

FRODO
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Yes, I'm here. And you're lucky to be
here, too. A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid. But you have
some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.

FRODO
What happened, Gandalf? Why didn't you
meet us?

GANDALF
I'm sorry Frodo.
I was delayed.

STOP

SARUMAN
A friendship with Saruman is not
lightly thrown aside.

SARUMAN
One ill turn deserves another. It is
over. Embrace the power of the
Ring or embrace your own destruction!

GANDALF
There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only
one who can bend it to his will, and he
does not share power.

SARUMAN
So you have chosen death.

STOP

FRODO
Gandalf! What is it?

GANDALF
Nothing, Frodo.

SAM
Frodo! Frodo! Bless you, you're awake!

GANDALF
Sam has hardly left your side.

SAM
We were worried about you, weren't we,
Mister Gandalf?

GANDALF
By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're
beginning to mend.

ELROND
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

ELROND
You have found your way to the last
homely house east of the sea. The elves
of Imladris have dwelt within this valley
for three thousand years, though few of
my kin now remain.

MERRY
Frodo! Frodo!

STOP

FRODO
Bilbo!

BILBO
Hello, Frodo, my lad!

STOP

FRODO
"There and back again: A Hobbit's tale"
by Bilbo Baggins.

FRODO
This is wonderful!

BILBO
I meant to go back, wander the paths of
Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely
Mountain again. But age, it seems, has
finally caught up with me.

FRODO
I miss the Shire. I spent all my
childhood pretending I was off somewhere
else. Off with you, on one of your
adventures.
But my own adventure, turned out to be
quite different. I'm not like you,
Bilbo.

BILBO
My dear boy.

STOP

SAM
No, what have I forgotten?

FRODO
Packed already?

SAM
No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls
to the edge of the Balcony.

FRODO
I thought you wanted to see the Elves,
Sam?

SAM
I do.

FRODO
More than anything.

SAM
I did. It's just - we did what Gandalf
wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this
far, to Rivendell, and I thought:
Seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be
off soon. Off home.

FRODO
You're right, Sam.
We did what we set out to do.

FRODO
the Ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am
ready to go home.

STOP

ELROND
His strength returns.

GANDALF
That wound will never fully heal. He will
carry it the rest of his life.

ELROND
And yet to have come so far still bearing
the Ring. The hobbit has shown
extraordinary resilience to its evil.

GANDALF
It is a burden he should never have to
had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.

ELROND
Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's
forces are massing in the East. His Eye
is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you
tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of
allies grows thin.

GANDALF
His treachery runs deeper than you know.
By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc
with Goblin Men. He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard. An army that
can move in Sunlight and cover great
distance at speed. Saruman is coming for
the Ring.

ELROND
This evil cannot be concealed by the
power of the Elves. We do not have the
strength to fight both Mordor and
Isengard. Gandalf, the Ring cannot stay
here.

ELROND
This peril belongs to all Middle-Earth.
They must decide now how to end it.

ELROND
The time of the Elves is over. My people
are leaving these shores. Who will you
look to when we have gone? The dwarves?
They hide in their mountains seeking
riches. They care nothing for the
troubles of others.

GANDALF
It is in Men that we must place our hope.

ELROND
Men? Men are weak.The race of Men is
failing. The blood of Númenor is all but
spent, its pride and dignity forgotten.
It is because of Men the Ring survives.

ELROND
I was there, Gandalf. I was there three
thousand years ago when Isildur took the
ring.

ELROND
I was there the day the strength of Men
failed.

STOP

ELROND
Isildur, hurry, follow me!

ELROND
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount
Doom, where the Ring was forged: the one
place it could be destroyed.

ELROND
Cast it into the fire! Destroy it!

ISILDUR
No.

ELROND
Isildur!

STOP

ELROND
It should have ended that day, but evil
was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the
Ring, and the line of kings was broken.
There's no strength left in the world of
Men. They're scattered, divided,
leaderless.

GANDALF
There is one who could unite them, one
who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

ELROND
He turned from that path a long time ago.
He has chosen exile.

STOP

BOROMIR
You are no Elf.

STRIDER
Men of the South are welcome here.

BOROMIR
Who are you?

STRIDER
I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

BOROMIR
Then we are here on common purpose- friend.

BOROMIR
The shards of Narsil! The blade that cut
the Ring from Sauron's hand.

BOROMIR
Still sharp.

BOROMIR
But no more than a broken heirloom.

STOP

ARWEN
Why do you fear the past? You are
Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself. You
are not bound to his fate.

STRIDER
The same blood flows in my veins. The
same weakness.

ARWEN
Your time will come. You will face the
same evil and you will defeat it.
The shadow does not hold
sway yet. Not over you and not over me.

STOP

ARWEN
Do you remember when we first met?

STRIDER
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

ARWEN
Long years have passed. You
did not have the care you carry now.

ARWEN
Do you remember what I told you?

STRIDER
You said you would bind yourself to me,
forsaking the immortal life of your
people.

ARWEN
And to that I hold. I would rather share
one lifetime with you than face all the
ages of this world alone.

ARWEN
I choose a mortal live.

STRIDER
You cannot give me this.

ARWEN
It is mine to give to whom I will, like
my heart.

STOP

ELROND
Strangers from distant lands, friends
of old. You have been summoned here to
answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth
stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it. You will unite, or
you will fall. Each race is bound to this
fate, this one doom.

ELROND
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

BOROMIR
So it is true!

LEGOLAS
Sauron's Ring! The Ring of Power!

GIMLI
The doom of man!

BOROMIR
In a dream, I saw the Eastern sky grow
dark, but in the West a pale light
lingered. A voice was crying, "Our
doom is near at hand! Isildur's
Bane is found."

Boromir
Isildur's Bane.

ELROND
Boromir!

GANDALF
Ash nazg durbatulûk,
ash nazg gimbatul,
ash nazg thrakatulûk
agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
One Ring to rule them all,
One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all
and in the Darkness bind them.

ELROND
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

GANDALF
I do not ask your pardon, Master
Elrond, for the Black Speech of Mordor
may yet be heard in every corner of the
West! The Ring is altogether evil.

BOROMIR
It is a gift. A gift to the foes of
Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has
my father, the Steward of Gondor, held
the forces of Mordor at bay. By the
blood of our people are your lands kept
safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the
enemy! Let us use it against him!

STRIDER
You cannot wield it. None of us can.
The one ring answers to Sauron alone, it
has no other master.

BOROMIR
And what would a ranger know of this
matter?

LEGOLAS
This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn,
son of Arathorn. You owe him your
allegiance.

BOROMIR
Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?

LEGOLAS
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

ARAGORN
Legolas! Sit down, Legolas.

BOROMIR
Gondor has no king. Gondor needs no king.

GANDALF
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

ELROND
You have only one choice. The Ring must
be destroyed.

GIMLI
Then what are we waiting for?

ELROND
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son
of Glóin, by any craft that we here possess.
The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom,
only there can it be unmade. It must be
taken deep into Mordor, and cast back into
the fiery chasm from whence it came.
One of you must do this.

BOROMIR
One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its
black gates are guarded by more than just
Orcs. There is evil there that does not
sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful.
It is a barren wasteland, riddled with
fire and ash and dust. The very air you
breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with
ten thousand men could you do this. It
is folly.

LEGOLAS
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has
said? The Ring must be destroyed.

GIMLI
And I suppose you think you're the one to
do it?

BOROMIR
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

GIMLI
I will be dead before I see the Ring in
the hands of an Elf!

GIMLI
Never trust an Elf!

GANDALF
Do you not understand? While we bicker
among ourselves, Sauron's power grows!
No one will escape it. You will all be
destroyed, with your homes burnt and your
families put to the sword!

FRODO
I will take it. I will take it! I will
take the Ring to Mordor.

FRODO
Though I do not know the way.

GANDALF
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo
Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.

ARAGORN
If, by my life or death I can protect
you, I will.

ARAGORN
you have my sword.

LEGOLAS
And you have my bow.

GIMLI
And my axe!

BOROMIR
You carry the fate of us all, little one.

BOROMIR
If this is indeed the will of the
Council, then Gondor will see it done.

SAM
Here!
Mister Frodo's not going anywhere without me.

ELROND
No, Indeed. It is hardly possible to
separate you, even when he is summoned
to a secret council and you are not.

MERRY
Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to
send us home tied up in a sack to stop
us.

PIPPIN
Anyway, you need people of intelligence
on this sort of - mission. quest. thing.

MERRY
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

ELROND
Nine companions. So be it.
You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.

PIPPIN
Great. Where are we going?

STOP

ELROND
She wanted to protect her child.
She thought that in Rivendell you
would be safe.

ELROND
In her heart, your mother knew you’d be
hunted all your life. That you’d never
escape your fate. The skill of the
Elves can reforge the sword of kings,
but only you have the power to wield
it.

ARAGORN
I do not want that power. I have never
wanted it.

ELROND
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

STOP

BILBO
My old sword "Sting". Here, take it!

FRODO
It's so light!

BILBO
Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.
The blade glows blue when Orcs are
close. And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

BILBO
Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light
as a feather, and as hard as dragon
scales. Let me see you put it on. Come
on.

BILBO
Oh! My old Ring!

BILBO
I should very much like to hold it again,
one last time.

BILBO
Aaaaargh!

BILBO
I'm sorry, that I brought this upon
you, my boy. I'm sorry that you must
carry this burden. I'm sorry for
everything.

STOP

ELROND
The Ring-bearer is setting out on
the Quest of Mount Doom. On you who
travel with him, no oath nor bond is
laid to go further that you will.
Farewell. Hold to your purpose. May
the blessing of Elves and Men and all
Free Folk go with you.

GANDALF
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

FRODO
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

GANDALF
Left.

STOP

GANDALF
We must hold to this course, west of
the Misty Mountains, for forty days. If
our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will
still be open to us. From there, our
road turns east, to Mordor.

BOROMIR
Get away from the blade, Pippin! On your
toes - good, very good. I want you to
react, not think.

SAM
Should not be too hard.

BOROMIR
Move your feet.

MERRY
Quite good, Pippin.

PIPPIN
Thanks.

GIMLI
If anyone were to ask for my opinion,
which I note they have not, I would say
we are taking the long way round.
Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of
Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a
royal welcome.

GANDALF
No, Gimli. I would not take the road
through Moria unless I had no other
choice.

SAM
What is that?

GIMLI
Nothing, it's just a wisp of a cloud.

BOROMIR
It's moving fast. Against the wind.

LEGOLAS
Crebain from Dunland!

ARAGORN
Hide!

BOROMIR
Merry, Pippin, Sam! Take cover!

GANDALF
Spies of Saruman.The passage South is
being watched.

GANDALF
We must take the pass of Caradhras!

STOP

ARAGORN
Boromir?

BOROMIR
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt over so
small a thing. Such a little thing.

ARAGORN
Boromir! Give the Ring to Frodo.

BOROMIR
As you wish. I care not.

STOP

SARUMAN
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over
Caradhras. And if that fails, where
then will you go?

SARUMAN
If the mountain defeats you, will you
risk a more dangerous road?

SARUMAN
Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; nai
yarvaxea rasselya!
Wake up cruel Redhorn! May your
horn be bloodstained!

LEGOLAS
There is a fell voice in the air.

GANDALF
It's Saruman!

ARAGORN
He's trying to bring down the mountain.
Gandalf! We must turn back!

GANDALF
No!

GANDALF
Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i
ruith.
Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie
still, hold your wrath.

SARUMAN
Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; Nai yarvaxea
rasselya; taltuva notto-carinnar!
Wake up cruel Redhorn! May your
bloodstained horn fall upon enemy heads!

BOROMIR
We must get off the mountain! Make for
the Gap of Rohan and take the West road
to my city!

ARAGORN
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to
Isengard.

GIMLI
We cannot pass over the mountain. Let us
go under it. Let us go through the Mines
of Moria.

SARUMAN
Moria. You fear to go into those mines,
don't you? The Dwarves delved too
greedily and too deep.

SARUMAN
You know what they awoke in, the darkness
of Khazad-dûm. Shadow and flame.

GANDALF
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

GANDALF
Frodo?

FRODO
We will go through the mines.

GANDALF
So be it.

STOP

GANDALF
Frodo, come and help an old man.

GANDALF
How is your shoulder?

FRODO
Better than it was.

GANDALF
And the Ring? You feel its power growing,
don’t you? I’ve felt it too. You must be
careful now. Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship. And, I fear,
from within.

FRODO
Who then do I trust?

GANDALF
You must trust yourself. Trust
your own strengths.

FRODO
What do you mean?

GANDALF
There are many powers in this
world for good or for evil. Some
are greater than I am. And
against some I have not yet been
tested.

GIMLI
The walls of Moria!

STOP

GIMLI
Dwarf doors are invisible when
closed.

GANDALF
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot
find them if their secrets are
forgotten.

LEGOLAS
Why doesn’t that surprise me?

GANDALF
Ithildin. It mirrors only starlight and
moonlight.

GANDALF
It reads, "The door of Durin, Lord of
Moria. Speak, friend, and enter."

MERRY
What do you suppose that means?

GANDALF
It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
speak the password and the doors will
open.

GANDALF
Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen!
Gate of the Elves, open now for me!

GANDALF
Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen.
Doorway of the Dwarf-folk, listen
to the word of my tongue.

PIPPIN
Nothing's happening.

GANDALF
I once knew every spell in all
the tongues of Elves, Men, and
Orcs.

PIPPIN
What are you going to do, then?

GANDALF
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took! And if that does not
shatter them, and I am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions, I will
try to find the opening words.

STOP

GANDALF
Ando Eldarinwa, a lasta quettanya,
Fenda Casarinwa-
Gate of Elves, listen to my word,
Threshold of Dwarves-

ARAGORN
Mines are no place for a Pony, even one
so brave as Bill.

SAM
Bye, Bill.

ARAGORN
Go on, Bill, go on. Don't worry, Sam. He
knows his way home.

SAM
Goodbye, Bill.

ARAGORN
Do not disturb the water.

FRODO
It's a riddle.

FRODO
Speak, friend, and enter. What's the
Elvish for friend?

GANDALF
Oh- mellon.

STOP

GIMLI
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the fabled
hospitality of the Dwarves; roaring
fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.
This, my friend, is the home of my
cousin, Balin, and they call this a
mine. A mine!

BOROMIR
This is no mine. It's a tomb!

GIMLI
Oh no. No. No!

LEGOLAS
Goblins!

BOROMIR
We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should
never have come here.

GANDALF
Into the mines!

BOROMIR
Legolas!

GANDALF
Now we have but one choice: We must face
the long dark of Moria. Be on your
guard! There are older and fouler things
than the Orcs in the deep places of the
world.

STOP

GANDALF
Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to
the other side. Let us hope that our
presence will go unnoticed.

GANDALF
The wealth of Moria was not in gold or
jewels but mithril.

GANDALF
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

GIMLI
Oh, that was a kingly gift.

GANDALF
Yes. I never told him, but its worth
was greater than the value of the
Shire.

STOP

GANDALF
I have no memory of this place.

PIPPIN
Are we lost?

MERRY
No. I don't think we are. Shhhh,
Gandalf's thinking.

PIPPIN
Merry!

MERRY
What?

PIPPIN
I'm hungry.

FRODO
There's something down there.

GANDALF
It's Gollum.

FRODO
Gollum!

GANDALF
He's been following us for three days.

FRODO
He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?

GANDALF
Escaped, or was set loose. And now the
Ring has drawn him here. He will never
be rid of his need for it. He hates and
loves the Ring, as he hates and loves
himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story.

GANDALF
Yes, Smeagol he was once called. Before
the Ring came to him, before it drove him
mad.

FRODO
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he
had the chance.

GANDALF
Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's
hand. Many that live deserve death, and
some that die deserve life. Can you give
it to them, Frodo?

GANDALF
Do not be too eager to deal out death in
judgment, even the very wise cannot see
all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum
has some part to play yet, for good or
ill, before this is over. The pity of
Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

FRODO
I wish the Ring had never come to me.
I wish none of this had happened.

GANDALF
So do all who live to see such times, but
that is not for them to decide. All we
have to decide is what to do with the
time that is given to us.

GANDALF
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring. In
which case, you also were meant to have
it, and that is an encouraging thought.

GANDALF
Ah! It's that way!

MERRY
He's remembered!

GANDALF
No, but the air doesn't smell so foul
down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose!

STOP

GANDALF
Let me risk a little more light.

GANDALF
Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city
of Dwarrowdelf!

SAM
Well, there's an eye opener and no
mistake!

GANDALF
Gimli!

GIMLI
No. No - oh, no!

GANDALF
"Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of
Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I feared.

GIMLI
Kilmin malur ni zaram kalil ra
narag. Kheled-zâram. Balin
tazlifi.

LEGOLAS
We must move on, we cannot linger.

GANDALF
"They have taken the Bridge and the
second hall: We have barred the
gates, but cannot hold them for
long. The ground shakes. Drums in the
deep. We cannot get out. A shadow moves
in the dark. Will no-one save us? They
are coming."

GANDALF
Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next
time and rid us of your stupidity!

SAM
Mister Frodo!

LEGOLAS
Orcs!

ARAGORN
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.

BOROMIR
They have a cave-troll!

GIMLI
Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in
Moria who still draws breath!

SAM
I think I’m getting the hang of this.

STOP

SAM
He's alive!

FRODO
I'm alright. I'm not hurt.

ARAGORN
You should be dead. That spear would
have skewered a wild boar.

GANDALF
I think there's more to this hobbit than
meets the eye.

GIMLI
Mithril! You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

GANDALF
To the bridge of Khazad-Dûm!

GANDALF
This way!

STOP

BOROMIR
What is this new devilry?

GANDALF
A Balrog. A demon of the ancient world!
This foe is beyond any of you!
Run! Quickly!

GANDALF
Lead them on, Aragorn! The bridge is
near.

GANDALF
Do as I say; swords are no more use here.

GIMLI
Nobody tosses a dwarf!

STOP

GANDALF
Over the bridge! Fly!

GANDALF
You cannot pass!

FRODO
Gandalf!

GANDALF
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark
fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!

GANDALF
Go back to the Shadow!

GANDALF
You shall not pass!

FRODO
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Fly, you fools!

FRODO
No!

ARAGORN
Gandalf!

STOP

ARAGORN
Legolas, get them up!

BOROMIR
Give them a moment for pity's sake!

ARAGORN
By nightfall these hills will be swarming
with Orcs! We must reach the woods of
Lothlorien. Come, Boromir, Legolas,
Gimli, get them up. On your feet, Sam.

ARAGORN
Frodo? Frodo!

STOP

LEGOLAS
Ah, Lothlórien. The fairest of all the
dwellings of my people. There are no
trees like the trees of this land, for
in autumn the leaves fall not, but turn
to gold. Not till the spring comes and
the new green opens do they fall, and
then the boughs are laden with yellow
flowers; and the floor of the wood is
golden, and golden is the roof, and its
pillars are of silver, for the bark of
the trees is smooth and grey. So still
our songs in Mirkwood say.

GIMLI
Stay close, young hobbits. They say a
Sorceress lives in these woods. An elf-
witch of terrible power. All who look
upon her fall under her spell.

GALADRIEL
Frodo-

GIMLI
And are never seen again!

GALADRIEL
Your coming to us is as the footsteps
of doom. You bring great evil here,
Ringbearer.

SAM
Mister Frodo?

GIMLI
Well, here's one dwarf she won't
ensnare so easily. I have the eyes of a
hawk and the ears of a fox!

HALDIR
The dwarf breathes so loud we could have
shot him in the dark.

STOP

HALDIR
Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion.
Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.

LEGOLAS
Govannas vîn gwennen le, Haldir o Lórien.
Our Fellowship stands in your debt,
Haldir of Lórien.

HALDIR
A, Aragorn in Dúnedain istannen le
ammen.
Oh, Aragorn of the Dúnedain, you
are known to us.

ARAGORN
Haldir.

GIMLI
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves! Speak words we can
also understand!

HALDIR
We have not had dealings with the
Dwarves since the Dark Days.

GIMLI
And you know what this Dwarf says
to that? Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul!
I spit on your grave!

ARAGORN
That was not so courteous.


HALDIR
You bring great evil with you.
You can go no further.

STOP

ARAGORN
Boe ammen veriad lîn. Andelu i ven!
We need your protection. The road
is fell!

ARAGORN
Merin le telim.
I wish we may come with you.

ARAGORN
Henio, aníron boe ammen i dulu
lîn!
Please, understand, we need
your support!

ARAGORN
Andelu i ven.
The road is very dangerous.

BOROMIR
Gandalf's death was not in vain.
nor would he have you give up hope.
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

HALDIR
Very well. Here we will stay awhile,
and come to the city of Galadhrim on
the morrow.

STOP

FRODO
What is it?

SAM
It’s an odd thing, Mr. Frodo. It’s
sunlight and bright day, right enough.
I thought that Elves were all for moon
and stars. But this is more Elvish than
anything I ever heard tell of. I feel
as if I was inside a song, if you take
my meaning.

HALDIR
You feel the power of the Lady of
Galadhrim. Would it please you to
climb with me up Cerin Amroth?

HALDIR
There lies the fastness of Southern
Mirkwood. It is clad in a forest of
dark fir, where the trees strive one
against another and their branches rot
and whither. In the midst upon a stony
height stands Dol Guldur, where long
the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We
fear that now it is inhabited again,
and with power sevenfold. A black cloud
lies often over it of late.

HALDIR
In this high place you may see the two
powers that are oppose one to another;
and ever they strive now in thought,
but whereas the light perceives the
very heart of the darkness, its own
secret has not been discovered. Not
yet.

STOP

ARAGORN
Arwen vanimelda, namárië.

ARAGORN
Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth,
and here my heart dwells ever, unless
there be a light beyond the dark roads
that we still must tread, you and I.

FRODO
Do you believe we may yet succeed
in our quest?

ARAGORN
We shall endure to the last.

STOP

HALDIR
Caras Galadon. The heart of Elvendom on
earth. This is the city of Galadhrim
where dwell the Lord Celeborn and of
Galadriel, Lady of Light.

STOP

CELEBORN
The enemy knows you have entered here.
What hope you had in secrecy is now
gone. Eight there are, yet nine
there were set out from Rivendell.
Tell me, where is Gandalf? For I much
desire to speak with him. I can no
longer see him from afar.

GALADRIEL
Gandalf the Grey did not pass the
borders of this land. He has fallen
into Shadow.

LEGOLAS
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.
A Balrog of Morgoth. For we went
needlessly into the net of Moria.

GALADRIEL
Needless were none of the deeds of
Gandalf in life. We do not yet know his
full purpose.

GALADRIEL
Do not let the great emptiness of
Khazad-dûm fill your heart Gimli, son
of Glóin. For the world has grown full
of peril, and in all lands, love is now
mingled with grief.

GALADRIEL
The quest stands upon the edge of a
knife. Stray but a little and it will
fail, to the ruin of all. Yet hope
remains while the company is true.

GALADRIEL
Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go
now and rest for you are weary with
sorrow and much toil.

GALADRIEL
Tonight you will sleep in peace.
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire-

GALADRIEL
the one who has seen the eye.

STOP

LEGOLAS
A lament for Gandalf.

MERRY
What do they say about him?

LEGOLAS
I have not the heart to tell you. For me,
the grief is still too near.

SAM
I bet they don’t mention his
fireworks. There should be a verse
about them.

SAM
The finest rockets ever seen
They burst in stars of blue and green
Or after thunder, silver showers
Come falling like a rain of flowers.
Oh, that doesn’t do them justice
by a long road.

ARAGORN
Take some rest. These borders are well
protected.

BOROMIR
I will find no rest here. I heard her
voice inside my head. She spoke of my
father and the fall of Gondor, and she
said to me: "Even now, there is hope left."
But I cannot see it! It is long since
we had any hope.

BOROMIR
My father is a noble man, but his rule is
failing and our - our people lose faith.
He looks to me to make things right. And
I would do it, I would see the glory of
Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it,
Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion,
glimmering like a spike of pearl and
silver, its banners caught high in the
morning breeze. Have you ever been
called home by the clear ringing of
silver trumpets?

ARAGORN
I have seen the white city, long ago.

BOROMIR
One day our paths will lead us there, and
the tower guards shall take up the call
"the Lords of Gondor have returned."

STOP

GALADRIEL
Will you look into the mirror?

FRODO
What will I see?

GALADRIEL
Even the wisest cannot tell for the
mirror shows many things: Things that
were. Things that are. And some things
that have not yet come to pass.

STOP

GALADRIEL
I know what it is you saw, for it is
also in my mind. It is the future,
Frodo. It is what will come to pass if
you should fail.

GALADRIEL
The Fellowship is breaking. It has
already begun. He will try to take the
ring. You know of whom I speak. One by
one, it will destroy them all.

FRODO
If you ask it of me, I will give you the
One Ring.

GALADRIEL
You offer it to me freely! I do not deny
that my heart has greatly desired this.

GALADRIEL
In place of the Dark Lord, you would have
a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and
terrible as the Dawn! Treacherous as the
Sea! Stronger than the foundations of
the earth! All shall love me and
despair!

GALADRIEL
I pass the test.
I will diminish and go into the west and
remain Galadriel.

FRODO
I cannot do this alone.

GALADRIEL
You are Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear
a Ring of Power is to be alone.

GALADRIEL
This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant. And
I am its keeper.

GALADRIEL
This task was appointed to you. And
if you do not find a way, no one will.

FRODO
Then I know what I must do. It's
just I'm afraid to do it.

GALADRIEL
Even the smallest person can change the
course of the future.

STOP

SARUMAN
Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?
They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark
Powers, tortured and mutilated. A
ruined and terrible form of life. And
now, perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai.
Whom do you serve?

LURTZ
Saruman.

SARUMAN
Hunt them down. Do not stop until they
are found. You do not know pain. You do
not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.

SARUMAN
One of the Halflings carries something of
great value. Bring him to me, alive and
unspoiled. Kill the others.

STOP

CELEBORN
May these cloaks help shield you from
unfriendly eyes.

LEGOLAS
Lembas. Elvish waybread.

LEGOLAS
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

MERRY
How many did you eat?

PIPPIN
Four.


CELEBORN
Every league you travel south, the
danger will increase. Mordor Orcs now
hold the eastern shore of the Anduin.
Nor will you find safety on the western
bank.

CELEBORN
Strange creatures bearing the White
Hand have been seen on our borders.
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

CELEBORN
Le aphadar aen.
You are being tracked.

CELEBORN
By river you have the chance of
outrunning the enemy to the Falls of
Rauros.

STOP

GALADRIEL
My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of
the Galadhrim. Worthy of the skill of
our woodland kin.

GALADRIEL
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.
They have already seen service in war.


GALADRIEL
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.
You will find your courage.

GALADRIEL
And for you, Samwise Gamgee, Elven
rope made of hithlain.

SAM
Thank you, my lady.
Have you run out of those nice, shiny
daggers?

GALADRIEL
And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the
Elves?

GIMLI
Nothing. Except to look upon the lady of the
Galadhrim one last time for she is
more fair than all the jewels beneath
the earth.

GIMLI
Actually, there was one thing. No,
no, I couldn’t. It’s quite impossible.
Stupid to ask.

GALADRIEL
I have nothing greater to give than
the gift you already bear.

GALADRIEL
Am meleth dîn. I ant e-guil Arwen
Undómiel pelitha.
For her love, I fear the grace of
Arwen Evenstar, will diminish.

ARAGORN
Aníron i e broniatha ar periatham
amar hen. Aníron e ciratha a
Valannor.
I would have her leave these shores,
and be with her people. I would have
her take the ship to Valinor.

GALADRIEL
That choice is yet before her. You have
your own choice to make, Aragorn.

GALADRIEL
To rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of Elendil or to
fall into darkness with all that is
left of your kin.

GALADRIEL
Namárië.
Farewell.

GALADRIEL
Nadath nâ i moe cerich. Dan
ú-'eveditham, Elessar.
There is much you have yet to do.
We shall not meet again, Elessar.


GALADRIEL
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

GALADRIEL
I give you the light of Eärendil,
our most beloved star.

GALADRIEL
May it be a light for you in dark
places, when all other lights go out.

GIMLI
I have taken my worst wound at this
parting having looked my last upon
that which is fairest. Henceforth I
will call nothing fair unless it be
her gift to me.

LEGOLAS
What was her gift?

GIMLI
I asked her for one hair from her
golden head. She gave me three.

STOP

ARAGORN
Gollum. He has tracked us since
Moria.

ARAGORN
I had hoped we would lose him on
the river.

ARAGORN
But he’s too clever a waterman.

BOROMIR
And if he alerts the enemy to our
whereabouts, it will make the
crossing even more dangerous.

SAM
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

FRODO
No, Sam.

SAM
You haven’t eaten anything all day.
You’re not sleeping, neither. Don’t
think I haven’t noticed.

SAM
Mr. Frodo

FRODO
I’m all right.

SAM
But you’re not. I’m here to help you.
I promised Gandalf that I would.

FRODO
You can’t help me, Sam. Not this time.
Get some sleep.

BOROMIR
Minas Tirith is the safer road. You
know that. From there we can regroup.
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

ARAGORN
There is no strength in Gondor that
can avail us.

BOROMIR
You were quick enough to trust the
Elves.

BOROMIR
Have you so little faith in your own
people? Yes, there is weakness. There
is frailty. But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men. But you
will not see that.

BOROMIR
You are afraid!

BOROMIR
All your life, you have hidden in
the shadows.

BOROMIR
Scared of who you are, of what
you are.

ARAGORN
I will not lead the Ring within a
hundred leagues of your city.

STOP

ARAGORN
Frodo.

ARAGORN
The Argonath.

ARAGORN
Long have I desired to look upon the
kings of old. My kin.

STOP

ARAGORN
We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
boats and continue on foot. We approach
Mordor from the North.

GIMLI
Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable
labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And
after that gets even better! A
festering, stinking marshland, far as the
eye can see.

ARAGORN
That is our road. I suggest you take
some rest and recover your strength,
Master Dwarf.

GIMLI
Recover my-

LEGOLAS
We should leave now.

ARAGORN
No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We
must wait for cover of darkness.

LEGOLAS
It is not the Eastern shore that
worries me.

LEGOLAS
A shadow and a threat has been growing
in my mind. Something draws near, I can
feel it.

MERRY
Where's Frodo?

STOP

BOROMIR
None of us should wander alone; you least
of all. So much depends on you. Frodo?

BOROMIR
I know why you seek solitude. You
suffer, I see it day by day. Are you
sure you do not suffer needlessly?

BOROMIR
Let me help you. There are other ways,
Frodo, other paths that we might take.

FRODO
I know what you would say, and it would
seem like wisdom but for the warning of
my heart.

BOROMIR
Warning? Against what?

BOROMIR
We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that
fear drive us to destroy what hope we
have. Don't you see that is madness?

FRODO
There is no other way.

BOROMIR
I ask only for the strength to defend my
people.
If you would but lend me the Ring-

FRODO
No!

BOROMIR
Why do you recoil? I am no thief.

FRODO
You are not yourself.

BOROMIR
What chance do you think you have? They
will find you, they will take the Ring
and you will beg for death before the
end.

BOROMIR
You fool! It is not yours save by
unhappy chance! It might have been mine.
It should be mine. Give it to me! Give
me the Ring!

BOROMIR
I see your mind! You will take the Ring
to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to
your death - and the death of us all!
Curse you! Curse you and all the Halflings!

BOROMIR
Frodo! Frodo! What have I done? Please,
Frodo-

BOROMIR
I'm sorry, Frodo. Frodo-

STOP

SAURON
They will fall!

ARAGORN
Frodo?

FRODO
It has taken Boromir.

ARAGORN
Where is the Ring?

FRODO
Stay away!

ARAGORN
Frodo, I swore to protect you.

FRODO
Can you protect me from yourself?

FRODO
Would you destroy it?

ARAGORN
I would have gone with you to the end.
into the very fires of Mordor.

FRODO
I know. Look after the others,
especially Sam. He will not understand.

ARAGORN
Go, Frodo!

ARAGORN
Run! Run!

STOP

MERRY
Frodo!

MERRY
Hide here, quick!

PIPPIN
Come on!

PIPPIN
What's he doing?

MERRY
He's leaving.

PIPPIN
No!

MERRY
Run, Frodo. Go on!

MERRY
Hey, hey you! Over here!

PIPPIN
Hey! Over here!

PIPPIN
This way!

STOP

LEGOLAS
The horn of Gondor!

ARAGORN
Boromir!

BOROMIR
Run! Run!

MERRY & PIPPIN
Boromir! Boromir!

STOP

BOROMIR
They took the little ones-

BOROMIR
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

ARAGORN
I let Frodo go.

BOROMIR
Then you did what I could not. I tried
to take the Ring from him.

ARAGORN
The Ring is beyond our reach now.

BOROMIR
Forgive me, I did not see. I have failed
you all.

ARAGORN
No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You
have kept your honor.

BOROMIR
Leave it! It is over. The world of Men
will fall and all will come to darkness
and my city to ruin. Aragorn-

ARAGORN
I do not know what strength is in my
blood, but I swear to you: I will not
let the White City fall, nor your people
fail.

BOROMIR
Our people. Our people.

BOROMIR
I would have followed you, my
brother, my captain, my king.

ARAGORN
Be at peace, son of Gondor.

ARAGORN
They will look for his coming from the
white tower, but he will not return.

STOP

SAM
Mister Frodo!

SAM
Not alone, Frodo. Mister Frodo!

FRODO
No, Sam.

FRODO
Go back, Sam. I'm going to Mordor alone.

SAM
Of course you are. And I'm coming with
you!

FRODO
You can't swim! Sam!

SAM
I made a promise, Mister Frodo. A promise.
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to. I don't mean to.

FRODO
Oh, Sam!

FRODO
Come on then.

STOP

LEGOLAS
If we are quick, we will catch Frodo
and Sam before nightfall.

LEGOLAS
You mean not to follow them.

ARAGORN
Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

GIMLI
Then it has all been in vain. The
Fellowship has failed.

ARAGORN
Not if we hold true to each other. We
will not abandon Merry and Pippin to
torment and death, not while we have
strength left.

ARAGORN
Leave all that can be spared behind.

ARAGORN
We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.

GIMLI
Yes!

STOP

FRODO
Mordor! I hope the others find a safer
road.

SAM
Strider'll look after them.

FRODO
I don't suppose we'll ever see them
again.

SAM
We may yet, Mister Frodo. We may.

FRODO
Sam?

FRODO
I'm glad you're with me.
