GALADRIEL
The world is changed: I feel it in the
water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it
in the air. Much that once was is lost,
for none now live who remember it.

GALADRIEL
It began with the forging of the Great
Rings.

GALADRIEL
Three were given to the Elves, immortal,
wisest and fairest of all beings.

GALADRIEL
Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great miners
and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

GALADRIEL
And Nine, nine rings were gifted to the
race of Men who, above all else, desire
power.

GALADRIEL
For within these rings was bound the
strength and will to govern each race.

GALADRIEL
But they were all of them deceived.

GALADRIEL
for another ring was made.

GALADRIEL
In the land of Mordor, in the fires of
Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring to control all
others.

GALADRIEL
and into this Ring he poured his
cruelty, his malice and his will to
dominate all life.

GALADRIEL
One Ring to rule them all.

GALADRIEL
One by one the Free lands of Middle earth
fell to the power of the ring.

GALADRIEL
But there were some who resisted.

GALADRIEL
A last alliance of Men and Elves marched
against the armies of Mordor.

GALADRIEL
On the slopes of Mount Doom they fought
for the freedom of Middle- Earth.

GALADRIEL
Victory was near!

GALADRIEL
But the power of the Ring could not be
undone.

GALADRIEL
It was in this moment, when all hope had
faded, that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

GALADRIEL
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of
Middle Earth, was defeated.

GALADRIEL
The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this
one chance to destroy evil forever.

GALADRIEL
But the hearts of Men are easily
corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a
will of its own.

GALADRIEL
It betrayed Isildur to his death.

GALADRIEL
And some things that should not have been
forgotten, were lost.

GALADRIEL
History became legend, legend became
myth.

GALADRIEL
And for two and a half thousand years the
Ring passed out of all knowledge.

GALADRIEL
Until, when chance came, it ensnared a
new bearer!

GOLLUM
My Precious.

GALADRIEL
The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who
took it deep into the tunnels of the
Misty Mountains.

GALADRIEL
And there, it consumed him.

GOLLUM
It came to me. My own. My love,
my preciousness.

GALADRIEL
The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long
life. For five hundred years it poisoned
his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's
cave, it waited.

GALADRIEL
Darkness crept back into the forests of
the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the
East. Whispers of a nameless fear. And
the Ring of Power perceived its time
had now come. It abandoned Gollum.

GALADRIEL
But something happened then the Ring did
not intend.

GALADRIEL
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

BILBO
What's this?

GALADRIEL
A Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

BILBO
(surprised)
A Ring.

GOLLUM
Lost! Lost! My Precious is lost!!

GALADRIEL
For the time will soon come when Hobbits
will shape the fortunes of all.

STOP

FRODO
You're late.

GANDALF
A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,
nor is he early. He arrives precisely
when he means to.

FRODO
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

GANDALF
You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle
Bilbo's birthday?

FRODO
What news of the outside world? Tell me
everything!

GANDALF
What, everything? Far too eager and
curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural.

GANDALF
Well, what can I tell you? Life in the
wide world goes on much as if it has past
age. Full of its own comings and goings,
scarcely even aware of the existence of
Hobbits, for which I am very thankful.

STOP

GANDALF
Ah, the long expected party. So, how is
the old rascal? I hear it's going to be
a Party of Special Magnificence.

FRODO
You know Bilbo. He's got he whole place
in an uproar.

GANDALF
Oh, well. That should please him.

FRODO
Half the Shire's been invited.

GANDALF
Good gracious, me.

FRODO
He's up to something.

GANDALF
Oh, really?

FRODO
Alright then. Keep your secrets. Before
you came along we Bagginses were very
well thought of.

GANDALF
Indeed?

FRODO
Never had any adventures or did anything
unexpected.

GANDALF
If you're referring to the incident with
the Dragon, i was barely involved. All
I did was give your Uncle a little nudge
out the door.

FRODO
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.

GANDALF
Oh, really?

STOP

FRODO
Gandalf, I'm glad you're back.

GANDALF
So am I, dear boy. So am I

STOP

BILBO
No, thank you! We don't want any more
visitors, well wishers, or distant
relations!

GANDALF
And what about very old friends?

BILBO
Gandalf?

GANDALF
Bilbo Baggins!

BILBO
My dear Gandalf!

GANDALF
It's good to see you. One hundred and
eleven years old, who would believe it!

GANDALF
You haven't aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo
laugh together and enter Bag End.

BILBO
Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome!!

STOP

BILBO
Tea? Or maybe something stronger? I've
a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,
1296. A very good year, almost as old as
I am. It was laid down by my father. What
say we open one, eh?

BILBO
I was expecting you some time last week.
Not that it matters, you come and go as
you please, always have done, always
will.

BILBO
You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm
afraid. We've only got cold chicken, bit
of pickle, some cheese here, ooh, no,
that might be a little risky

BILBO
Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
tart. Got some custard somewhere. Not
much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh
no, we're alright! I've just found some
sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope
it's enough. I could do you some eggs
if you like?

GANDALF
Just tea, thank you.

BILBO
Oh, right. You don't mind if?

GANDALF
No, not at all. Go ahead.

STOP

MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS
Bilbo Baggins, you open this door! I know you're in there.

BILBO
I'm not home.

BILBO
I've got to get away from these
confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
all day, never giving me a moment's
peace. I want to see mountains
again. Mountains, Gandalf! And then
find somewhere quiet where I can finish
my book. Oh, Tea!

GANDALF
So, you mean to go through with your
plan, then?

BILBO
Yes, yes, it's all inhand. All the
arrangements are made.

GANDALF
Frodo suspects something.

BILBO
'Course he does, he's a Baggins! Not
some block headed Bracegirdle from
Hardbottle!

GANDALF
You will tell him, won't you?

BILBO
Yes, yes.

GANDALF
He's very fond of you.

BILBO
I know. He'd probably come with me if I
asked him. I think, in his heart,
Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the
woods and the fields, little rivers.

BILBO
I am old, Gandalf.

BILBO
I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning
to feel it in my heart.

BILBO
I feel thin, sort of stretched, like
butter scraped over too much bread. I
need a holiday. A very long holiday and
I don't expect I shall return. In fact,
I mean not to.

STOP

BILBO
Old Toby, the finest weed in
Southfarthing!

BILBO
Ohhhh, Gandalf my old friend, this will be a
night to remember!

STOP

FRODO
Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.

SAM
I think I'll just have myself another
ale.

FRODO
Oh, no you don't. Go on.

STOP

BILBO
So, there I was, at the mercy of three
monstrous trolls. Have you ever heard of
a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?
Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly
things. And they're arguing, arguing
about how they were going to cook us!

BILBO
Whether it be turned on a spit or minced
in a pie or whether they were going to
sit on us one by one and squash us into
jelly! But they spent so long arguing
the whether-to's and why-for's that the
sun's first light crept over the top of
the trees. And turned them all to stone!

STOP

MERRY
No, no, the big one! The big one!

MERRY
You're supposed to stick it in the
ground!

PIPPIN
It is in the ground.

MERRY
Outside!

PIPPIN
It was your idea.

STOP

FRODO
Bilbo! Watch out for the dragon!!

BILBO
Dragon? Nonsense! Hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years!

STOP

MERRY
That was good!

PIPPIN
Let's get another one!

GANDALF
Meridoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.
I might have known!

STOP

FRODO
Speech!

BILBO
My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and
Brandybucks, Grubbs, Chubbs,
Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and
Proudfoots.

ODO PROUDFOOT
Proudfeet!

BILBO
Today is my one hundred and eleventh
birthday. Yes, and alas, eleventy- one
years is far too short a time to live
among such excellent and admirable
Hobbits!

BILBO
I don't know half of you half as well as
I should like; and I like less than half
of you as well as well as you deserve.

BILBO
I have things to do and I have put this
off for far too long.

BILBO
I regret to announce, this is the end. I
am going now. I bid you all a very fond
farewell!

BILBO
Goodbye.

STOP

GANDALF
I suppose you think that was terribly
clever?

BILBO
Come on, Gandalf! Did you see their
faces?

GANDALF
There are many magic rings in the world,
Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be
used lightly.

BILBO
It was just a bit of fun. Oh, you're
probably right as usual.

GANDALF
You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

BILBO
I'm leaving everything to him.

GANDALF
What about this ring of yours? Is that
staying too?

BILBO
Yes, yes, it's in an envelope, over
there on the mantelpiece.

BILBO
No, wait. It's here in my pocket.
Isn't that odd now? Yet, after
all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?

GANDALF
I think you should leave the Ring behind,
Bilbo. Is that so hard?

BILBO
Well, no, and yes. Now that it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it. It's
mine. I found it. It came to me!

GANDALF
There's no need to get angry.

BILBO
Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's
mine. My own, my precious.

GANDALF
Precious? It's been called that before,
but not by you.

BILBO
So? What business is it of yours what I
do with my own things?

GANDALF
I think you've had that ring quite long
enough.

BILBO
You want it for yourself!

GANDALF
Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some
conjurer of cheap tricks!

GANDALF
I am not trying to rob you. I am trying
to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to
Gandalf and hugs him.

GANDALF
All you long years we've been
friends. Trust me as you once did. Let
it go!

BILBO
You're right, Gandalf, the ring must go
to Frodo.

BILBO
It's late, the road is long. Yes, it is
time.

GANDALF
Bilbo?

BILBO
Hmmm?

GANDALF
The ring is still in your pocket.

BILBO
Oh, yes.

STOP

BILBO
I've thought up and ending for my
book: "And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

GANDALF
I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

BILBO
Goodbye, Gandalf.

GANDALF
Goodbye Bilbo.

GANDALF
Until our next meeting.

STOP

BILBO
It's mine, my own, my precious.

GANDALF
Riddles in the dark.

FRODO
Bilbo! Bilbo!

FRODO
He's gone, hasn't he? Frodo steps into
the living room.

FRODO
He talked for so long about leaving.
I didn't think he'd really do it.

FRODO
Gandalf?

GANDALF
Bilbo's ring.

GANDALF
He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's
left you Bag End, along with all his possessions.

GANDALF
The ring is yours now. But it somewhere
out of sight. Gandalf rises hurriedly and
starts to gather his things.

FRODO
Where are you going?

GANDALF
I have some things I must see to.

FRODO
What things?

GANDALF
Questions. Questions that need
answering.

FRODO
You've only just arrived!I don't
understand!

GANDALF
Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it
safe.

STOP

BLACK RIDER
Shire? Baggins?

FARMER MAGGOT
There's no Bagginses around here! They
are all up in Hobbiton, that way.

STOP

GANDALF
Is it secret? Is it safe?

FRODO
What are you doing?

GANDALF
Hold out your hand, Frodo. It is quite
cool.

GANDALF
What can you see? Can you see anything?

FRODO
Nothing, there's nothing. Wait.
There are markings.

FRODO
It's some form of Elvish, I can't read
it.

GANDALF
There are few who can. The language is
that of Mordor, which I will not utter
here.

GANDALF
In the common tongue it says, "One ring to rule them all, One
ring to find them, One ring to bring them all, and in the
darkness bind them."

GANDALF
This is the one ring forged by the dark
lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mount
Doom. Taken by Isildur from the hand of
Sauron himself.

FRODO
Bilbo found it in Gollom's cave.

GANDALF
For sixty years the ring lay quiet in
Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life,
delaying old age, but no longer Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has
awoken. It has heard its master's call.

FRODO
But he was destroyed. Sauron was
destroyed.

GANDALF
No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has
endured. His life force is bound to the
ring and the ring survived. Sauron has
returned. His Orcs have multiplied. His
fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the
land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this
ring to cover all the lands in the second
darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it,
all his thought is bent on it. For the
ring yearns, above all else, to return to
the hand of its master: they are one, the
ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must
never find out.

FRODO
Alright!

FRODO
We put it away, we keep it hidden! We
never speak of it again. No one know
it's here, do they? Gandalf shifts
uncomfortably.

FRODO
Do they, Gandalf?

GANDALF
There is one other who knew that Bilbo
had the Ring. I looked everywhere for
the creature Gollum, but the enemy found
him first.

GANDALF
I don't know how long they tortured
him, but amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words.

GOLLUM
(screaming)
Shire! Baggins!

FRODO
Shire! Baggins! That will lead them
here!

FRODO
Take it! Take it!

GANDALF
No, Frodo.

FRODO
You must take it.

GANDALF
You cannot offer me this ring.

FRODO
I'm giving it to you!

GANDALF
Don't tempt me, Frodo. I dare not take
it, not even to keep it safe.

GANDALF
Understand, Frodo! I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good. But through
me, it would wield a power too great and
terrible to imagine.

FRODO
But it cannot stay in the Shire!

GANDALF
No, no it can't.

FRODO
What must I do?

GANDALF
You must leave, and leave quickly. Get
out of the Shire.

FRODO
Where? Where shall I go?

GANDALF
Make for the village of Bree.

FRODO
Bree? What about you?

GANDALF
I will be waiting for you at the Inn of
the Prancing Pony.

FRODO
And the ring will be safe there?

GANDALF
I don't know, Frodo. I don't have any
answers. I must see the Head of my
Order. He is both wise and powerful.
Trust me, Frodo. He'll know what to go.

GANDALF
You'll have to leave the name of Baggins
behind you, for that name is not safe
outside the Shire.

GANDALF
Travel only by day and stay off the road.

FRODO
I can cut across country easily enough.

GANDALF
My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing
creatures. You can learn all that there
is to know about their ways in a month,
and yet, after a hundred years, they can
still surprise you.

GANDALF
Get down!

GANDALF
Confound it all! Samwise Gamgee, have
you been eavesdropping?

SAM
I ain't been dropping no eaves, sir!
Honest. I was just cutting the grass
under the window there, if you follow
me.

GANDALF
It's a little late for trimming the
hedges, don't you think?

SAM
I heard raised voices!

GANDALF
What did you hear? Speak!

SAM
Nothing important. That is, I heard a
good deal about a ring and a Dark Lord.
And something about the end of the world.
But please, Mister Gandalf, sir, don't
hurt me! Don't turn me into anything
unnatural!

GANDALF
No?

GANDALF
Perhaps not. I've thought of a better
use for you.

STOP

GANDALF
Come along, Samwise, keep up!

GANDALF
Be careful, both of you. The Enemy has
many spies in his service, many ways of
hearing: Birds and beasts.

GANDALF
Is it safe?

GANDALF
Never put it on, for then the agents of
the Dark Lord will be drawn to its
power. Always remember, Frodo, the ring
is trying to get back to its master. It
wants to be found.

STOP

SAM
This is it.

FRODO
This is what?

SAM
If I take one more step it'll be the
farthest away from home I've ever been.

FRODO
Come on, Sam.

FRODO
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

BILBO
It's a dangerous business, Frodo,
going out your door. You step onto the
road, and if you don't keep your feet,
there's not knowing where you might be
swept off to.

STOP

SARUMAN
Smoke rises once more from the mountain
of doom. The shadow takes shape in the
darkness of Mordor. The hour grows
late, and Gandalf the Grey rides to
Isengard seeking my counsel.

SARUMAN
For that is why you have come, is it not,
my old friend?

GANDALF
Saruman!

SARUMAN
Are you sure of this?

GANDALF
Beyond any doubt.

SARUMAN
So the ring of power has been found?

GANDALF
All these long years it was in the Shire,
under my very nose.

SARUMAN
And yet you did not have the wit to see
it! Your love of the Halfling's leaf has
clearly slowed your mind.

GANDALF
We still have time, time enough to
counter Sauron if we act quickly.

SARUMAN
Time? What time do you think we have?

SARUMAN
Sauron has regained much of his former
strength. He cannot yet take physical
form, but his spirit has lost none of
its potency. Concealed within his
fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all.
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth,
and flesh. You know of what I speak,
Gandalf. A great Eye, lidless, wreathed
in flame.

GANDALF
The eye of Sauron.

SARUMAN
He is gathering all evil to him.

SARUMAN
Very soon he will have summoned an army
great enough to launch an assault upon
Middle earth.

GANDALF
You know this? How?

SARUMAN
I have seen it.

GANDALF
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

SARUMAN
Why? Why should we fear to use it?

GANDALF
They are not all accounted for, the lost
seeing-stones. We do not know who else
may be watching.

SARUMAN
The hour is later than you think.
Sauron's forces are already moving. The
Nine have left Minas Morgul.

GANDALF
The nine!

SARUMAN
They crossed the river Isen in
Midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in
black.

GANDALF
They have reached the Shire?

SARUMAN
They will find the ring, and kill the
one who carries it.

SARUMAN
You did not seriously think a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?
There are none who can.

SARUMAN
Against the power of Mordor, there can be
no victory. We must join with him,
Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It
would be wise, my friend.

GANDALF
Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the
wise abandon reason for madness?

SARUMAN
I gave you the chance of aiding me
willingly, but you have elected the way
of pain.

STOP

SAM
Mister Frodo. Mister Frodo!

SAM
I thought I lost you.

FRODO
What are you talking about?

SAM
It's just something Gandalf said.

FRODO
What did he say?

SAM
He said: "Don't you leave him, Samwise
Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

FRODO
Sam, we're still in the Shire. What
could possibly happen?

PIPPIN
Frodo! Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.

MERRY
Hello Frodo!

SAM
What's the meaning of this!

MERRY
Sam, hold this.

SAM
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

FARMER MAGGOT
Who's that in my field! Get out of it!
Get out of my field, you young varmits!
I'll show you! Get out of my corn!

MERRY
I don't know why he's so upset, it's only
a couple of carrots.

PIPPIN
And some cabbages! And those three bags
of potatoes that we lifted last week.
And then the mushrooms the week before.

MERRY
Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly
over reacting.

PIPPIN
Run!

STOP

PIPPIN
That was close.

MERRY
Ow! I think I've broken something.

SAM
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.

MERRY
What? That was just a detour.
A shortcut!

SAM
A shortcut to what?

PIPPIN
Mushrooms!

FRODO
I think we should get off the road.

FRODO
Get off the road!

STOP

MERRY
What was that?

SAM
Anything?

FRODO
Nothing.

PIPPIN
What is going on?

MERRY
The Black rider was looking for
something. Or someone. Frodo?

SAM
Get down!

FRODO
I have to leave the Shire. Sam and I
must get to Bree.

MERRY
Right. Buckleberry Ferry. Follow me !

MERRY
There's another one!! Frodo, this way!

MERRY
Frodo, follow me!

MERRY
Get the ropes, Sam.

SAM
Frodo!

FRODO
How far to the nearest crossing?

MERRY
The brandwine bridge. Twenty miles.

STOP

FRODO
Come on.

GATEKEEPER
What do you want?

FRODO
We're headed for the prancing pony.

GATEKEEPER
Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what's more,
out of the Shire by your talk. What
business brings you to Bree?

FRODO
We wish to stay at the inn. Our business
is our own.

GATEKEEPER
All right, young sir, I meant no offense.

GATEKEEPER
It's my job to ask questions after
nightfall. There's talk of strange fold
abroad. Can't be too careful.

STOP

FRODO
Excuse me.

BUTTERBUR
Good evening, little masters. If you're
seeking accommodation, we've got some
nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms available,
Mister?

FRODO
Underhill. My name's Underbill.

BUTTERBUR
Underhill? Hmmmm.

FRODO
We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can
you tell him we've arrived?

BUTTERBUR
Gandalf, Gandalf. Oh.
Oh yes! I remember! Elderly chap, big
grey beard, pointy hat?

BUTTERBUR
Not seen him for six months.

SAM
What do we do now?

FRODO
Sam, he'll be here.He'll come.

PIPPIN
What's that?

MERRY
This, my friend, is a pint.

PIPPIN
It comes in pints? I'm getting one!

SAM
You've had a whole half already.

SAM
That fellow's done nothing but stare at
you since we've arrived.

FRODO
Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is
he?

BUTTERBUR
He's one of them Rangers; they're
dangerous folk they are, wandering the
wilds. What his right name is, I never
heard, but round here he's known as
Strider.

STOP

PIPPIN
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins! He's
over there!

PIPPIN
Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin
once removed, on his mother's side and my
third cousin twice removed on his
father's side, if you follow me.

STOP

STRIDER
You draw far too much attention to
yourself, Mister Underhill.

FRODO
What do you want?

STRIDER
A little more caution from you, that is
no trinket you carry.

FRODO
I carry nothing.

STRIDER
Indeed? I can usually avoid being seen
if I wish, but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

FRODO
Who are you?

STRIDER
Are you frightened?

FRODO
Yes.

STRIDER
Not nearly frightened enough. I know
what hunts you.

SAM
Let him go or I'll have you, Longshanks!

STRIDER
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit,
but that alone won't save you. You can
no longer wait for the Wizard, Frodo.
They're coming.

STOP

FRODO
Who are they?

STRIDER
They were once men.

STRIDER
Great Kings of men. Then Sauron the
deceiver gave to them Nine Rings of
Power. Blinded by their greed they took
them without question, one by one falling
into darkness and now they are slaves to
his will.

STRIDER
They are the Nazgul, Ringwraiths, neither
living or dead. At all times they feel
the presence of the ring, drawn to the
power of the one. They will never stop
hunting you.

STOP

FRODO
Where are you taking us?

STRIDER
Into the wild.

MERRY
How do, we know this Strider is a friend
of Gandalf?

FRODO
We have no choice but to trust him.

STRIDER
But where is he leading us?

STRIDER
To Rivendell, Master Gamgee. To the
house of Elrond.

SAM
Did you hear that, Bill? Rivendell!
We're going to see the Elves!

STOP

STRIDER
Gentlemen, we do not stop until
nightfall.

PIPPIN
What about breakfast?

STRIDER
You've already had it.

PIPPIN
We've had one, yes! But what about
Second Breakfast?

MERRY
I don't think he knows about second
breakfast, Pip.

PIPPIN
What about Elvenses, Luncheon, Afternoon
Tea, dinner? He knows about them,
doesn't he?

MERRY
I wouldn't count on it.

STOP

SARUMAN
The power of Isengard is at your command,
Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

SAURONS VOICE
Build me an army worth of Mordor.

ORC OVERSEER
What orders from Mordor, my Lord. What
does the eye command?

SARUMAN
We have work to do.

STOP

ORC OVERSEER
The trees are strong, my Lord. Their
roots go deep.

SARUMAN
Rip them all down.

STOP

STRIDER
This was once the great Watchtower of
Amon Sul. We shall rest here tonight.

STRIDER
There are for you. Keep them close. I'm
going to have a look around. Stay here.

STOP

FRODO
What are you doing?

MERRY
Tomatoes, sausages, and crispy bacon.

SAM
We saved some for you, Mister Frodo.

FRODO
Put it out, you fools! Put it out!

PIPPIN
Oh, that's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

FRODO
Go!

STOP

SAM
Mister Frodo!
Help him, Strider!

STRIDER
He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

SAM
Do something.

STRIDER
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine. Strider lifts
Frodo onto his shoulders.

STRIDER
Hurry!

SAM
We are six days from Rivendell.

STRIDER
Hold on, Frodo.

SAM
He'll never make it!

FRODO
Gandalf? Gandalf?

STOP

PIPPIN
Is he going to die?

STRIDER
No. He is passing into the shadow world,
he will soon become a wraith like them.

MERRY
They're close.

STRIDER
Sam, do you know the Athelas plant? Sam
looks blank.

SAM
Athelas?

STRIDER
Kingsfoil.

SAM
Kingsfoil. Aye.It's a weed.

STRIDER
It may help to slow the poison. Hurry!

ARWEN
What is this? A Ranger caught off his
guard?

STOP

ARWEN
Frodo, Im Arwen. Telin let thaed. I am
Arwen, I have come here to help you.
Hear my voice, come back to the light. Frodo's
eyes close.

PIPPIN
Who is she?

ARWEN
Frodo?

SAM
She's an elf.

ARWEN
He's fading, he's not going to last. We
must get him to my father.

ARWEN
I have been looking for you for two days.

PIPPIN
Where are you taking him?

ARWEN
There are five Wraiths behind you, where
the other four are, I do not know.

STRIDER
Stay with the hobbits. I'll
send horses for you.

ARWEN
I'm the faster rider.

STRIDER
The road is too dangerous.

ARWEN
If I can cross the river, the
power of my people can protect him.

PIPPIN
What are they saying?

ARWEN
I do not fear them.

STRIDER
Arwen: ride hard, don't look back.

ARWEN
Noro Lim, Asfaloth, Noro Lim!

SAM
What are you doing! Those Wraiths are
still out there!

STOP

WITCH KING
Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws
her sword and yells at the Witch King.

ARWEN
If you want him, come and claim him.

ARWEN
(Elvish)
Non o Chithaeglir, lasto Beth daer: Rimmo
nin Briunen Dan in Ulaer!

ARWEN
Nin o Chitaeglir, lasto Beth daer: Rimmo
nin Bruinen Dan in Ulaer!

ARWEN
No, no Frodo, no! Frodo, don't give
in! Not now!

ARWEN
What grace is given me, let it pass to
him. Let him be spared. Save him.

STOP

FRODO
Where am I?

GANDALF
You are in the House of Elrond, and it is
ten o'clock in the morning on October the
twenty-fourth, if you want to know.

FRODO
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be
here, too. A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid. You have
some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.

FRODO
What happened, Gandalf? Why didn't you
meet us?

GANDALF
I'm sorry Frodo.

GANDALF
I was delayed.

STOP

SARUMAN
Get up! Embrace the power of the
Ring or embrace your own destruction!

GANDALF
There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only
one who can bend it to his will, and he
does not share power.

SARUMAN
So you have chosen death.

STOP

FRODO
Gandalf! What is it? Gandalf returns his
attention to Frodo.

GANDALF
Nothing, Frodo.

SAM
Frodo! Frodo! Bless you, you're awake!!

GANDALF
Sam has hardly left your side.

SAM
We were worried about you--weren't we,
Mister Gandalf?

GANDALF
By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're
beginning to mend.

ELROND
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

ELROND
You have found your way to the last
homely house east of the sea. The elves
of Imladris have dwelt within this valley
for three thousand years, though few of
my kin now remain.

STOP

FRODO
(reading)
"There and back again: A Hobbit's tale"
by Bilbo Baggins.

FRODO
This is wonderful.

BILBO
I meant to go back, wander the paths of
Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely
Mountain again. But age, it seems, has
finally caught up with me.

FRODO
I miss the Shire. I spent all my
childhood pretending I was off somewhere
else. Off with you, on one of your
adventures.
But my own adventure, turned out to be
quite different. I'm not like you,
Bilbo.

BILBO
My dear boy.

STOP

SAM
No, what have I forgotten?

FRODO
Packed already?

SAM
No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls
to the edge of the Balcony.

FRODO
I thought you wanted to see the Elves,
Sam?

SAM
I do.

FRODO
More than anything.

SAM
I did. It's just - we did what Gandalf
wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this
far, to Rivendell, and I thought:
Seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be
off soon. Off home.

FRODO
You're right, Sam.

FRODO
We did what we set out to do.

FRODO
The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am
ready to go home.

STOP

ELROND
His strength returns.

GANDALF
That wound will never fully heal. He will
carry it the rest of his life.

ELROND
And yet to have come so far still bearing
the Ring. The hobbit has shown
extraordinary resilience to its evil.

GANDALF
It is a burden he should never have to
had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.

ELROND
Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's
forces are massing in the east. His eye
is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you
tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of
allies grows thin.

GANDALF
His treachery runs deeper than you know.
By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc
with Goblin Men. He is breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard. An army that
can move in Sunlight and cover great
distance at speed. Saruman is coming for
the Ring.

ELROND
This evil cannot be concealed by the
power of the Elves. We do not have the
strength to fight both Mordor and
Isengard. Gandalf, the ring cannot stay
here.

ELROND
This peril belongs to all Middle earth.
They must decide how to end it. Not just
for themselves but for those who come
after. Elrond approaches Gandalf.

ELROND
The time of the Elves is over. My people
are leaving these shores. Who will you
look to when we have gone? The dwarves?
They hide in their mountains seeking
riches. They care nothing for the
troubles of others.

GANDALF
It is in Men that we must place our hope.

ELROND
Men? Men are weak.The race of Men is
failing. The blood of Numenor is all but
spent, its pride anddignity forgotten.
It is because of menthe Ring survives.

ELROND
I was there, Gandalf. I was there three
thousand years ago when Isildur took the
ring.

ELROND
I was there the day the strength of Men
failed.

STOP

ELROND
Isildur, hurry! Follow me!

ELROND
I let Isildur into the heart of Mount
Doom, where the ring was forged: the one
place it could be destroyed.

ELROND
Cast it into the fire! Destroy it!

ISILDUR
No.

ELROND
Isildur!!

STOP

ELROND
It should have ended that day, but evil
was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the
Ring, and the line of Kings was broken.
There's no strength left in the world of
Men. They're scattered, divided,
leaderless.

GANDALF
There is one who could unite them, one
who could re claim the thrown of Gondor.

ELROND
He turned from that path a long time ago.
He has chosen exile.

STOP

BOROMIR
The shards of Narsil! The blade that cut
the Ring from Sauron's hand.

BOROMIR
Still sharp.

BOROMIR
But no more than a broken heirloom.

STOP

ARWEN
Why do you fear the past? You are
Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself. You
are not bound to his fate.

STRIDER
The same blood flows in my veins. The
same weakness.

ARWEN
Your time will come. You will face the
same evil and you will defeat it.
The shadow does not hold
sway yet. Not over you and not over me.

STOP

ARWEN
Do you remember when we first met?

STRIDER
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

ARWEN
Long years have passed. You
did not have the care you carry now.

ARWEN
Do you remember what I told you?

STRIDER
You said you'd bind yourself to me,
forsaking the immortal life of your
people.

ARWEN
And to that I hold. I would rather share
one lifetime with you than face all the
ages of this world alone.

ARWEN
I choose a mortal live.

STRIDER
You cannot give me this.

ARWEN
It is mine to give to whom I will, like
my heart.

STOP

ELROND
Strangers from distant lands, friends
of old. You have been summoned here to
answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth
stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it. You will unite, or
you will fall. Each race is bound to this
fate, this one doom.

ELROND
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

BOROMIR
So it is true!

LEGOLAS
Sauron's Ring! The ring of power!

GIMLI
The doom of man!

BOROMIR
It is a gift. A gift to the foes of
Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has
my father, the Steward of Gondor, held
the forces of Mordor at bay. By the
blood of our people are your lands kept
safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the
enemy! Let us use it against him!

STRIDER
You cannot wield it. None of us can.
The one ring answers to Sauron alone, it
has no other master.

BOROMIR
And what would a ranger know of this
matter?

LEGOLAS
This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn,
son of Arathorn. You owe him your
allegiance.

BOROMIR
Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?

LEGOLAS
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

ARAGORN
Legolas! Sit down, Legolas.

BOROMIR
Gondor needs no king.

GANDALF
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

ELROND
You have only one choice. The ring must
be destroyed.

GIMLI
Then what are we waiting for?

ELROND
The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son
of Gloin, by any craft that we here possess.
The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom,
only there can it be unmade. It must be
taken deep into Mordor, and cast back into
the fiery chasm from whence it came.
One of you must do this.

BOROMIR
One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its
black gates are guarded by more than just
Orcs. There is evil there that does not
sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful.
It is a barren wasteland, riddled with
fire and ash and dust. The very air you
breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with
ten thousand men could you do this. It
is folly.

LEGOLAS
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has
said? The ring must be destroyed.

GIMLI
And I suppose you think you're the one to
do it?

BOROMIR
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

GIMLI
I will be dead before I see the Ring in
the hands of an Elf!

GIMLI
Never trust an Elf!

GANDALF
Do you not understand? While we bicker
among ourselves, Sauron's power grows!
No one will escape it. You will all be
destroyed, your homes burnt and your
families put to the sword!

FRODO
I will take it. I will take it! I will
take the Ring to Mordor.

FRODO
Though I do not know the way.

GANDALF
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo
Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.

ARAGORN
If, by my life or death I can protect
you, I will.

ARAGORN
you have my sword.

LEGOLAS
And you have my bow.

GIMLI
And my axe!

BOROMIR
You carry the fate of us all, little one.

BOROMIR
If this is indeed the will of the
Council, then Gondor will see it done.

SAM
Here!
Mister Frodo's not going anywhere without me.

ELROND
No, Indeed. It is hardly possible to
separate you, even when he is summoned
to a secret council and you are not.

MERRY
Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to
send us home tied up in a sack to stop
us.

PIPPIN
Anyway, you need people of intelligence
on this sort of -
mission. quest. thing.

MERRY
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

ELROND
Nine companions. So be it.
You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring

PIPPIN
Great. Where are we going?

STOP

BILBO
My old sword "Sting". Here, take it!

FRODO
It's so light!

BILBO
Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.
The blade glows blue when Orcs are
close. And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

BILBO
Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light
as a feather, and as hard as dragon
scales. Let me see you put it on. Come
on.

BILBO
Oh! My old Ring!

BILBO
I should very much like to hold it again,
one last time.

BILBO
AARRRGH!

BILBO
I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you,
my boy, I'm sorry that you must carry
this burden. I'm sorry for everything.

STOP

BOROMIR
Get away from the blade, Pippin! On your
toes - good, very good. I want you to
react, not think.

SAM
Should not be too hard.

BOROMIR
Move your feet.

MERRY
Quite good, Pippin.

PIPPIN
Thanks.

GIMLI
If anyone were to ask for my opinion,
which I note they have not, I would say
we are taking the long way round.
Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of
Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a
royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks
that is a bad idea.

GANDALF
No, Gimli. I would not take the road
through Moria unless I had no other
choice.

SAM
What is that?

GIMLI
Nothing, it's just a wisp of a cloud.

BOROMIR
It's moving fast. Against the wind.

LEGOLAS
Crebain from Dunland!

ARAGORN
Hide!

BOROMIR
Merry, Pippin, Sam! Take cover!

GANDALF
Spies of Saruman.The passage South is
being watched.

GANDALF
We must take the pass of Caradhras!

STOP

ARAGORN
Boromir?

BOROMIR
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt over so
small a thing. Such a little thing.

ARAGORN
Boromir! Give the ring to Frodo.

BOROMIR
As you wish. I care not.

STOP

SARUMAN
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over
Caradhras. And if that fails, where
then will you go?

SARUMAN
If the mountain defeats you, will you
risk a more dangerous road?

LEGOLAS
There is a fell voice in the air.

GANDALF
It's Saruman.

ARAGORN
He's trying to bring down the mountain.
Gandalf! We must turn back!

GANDALF
No!

GANDALF
Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie
still, hold your wrath.

BOROMIR
We must get off the mountain! Make for
the gap of Rohan and take the West road
to my city.

ARAGORN
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to
Isengard.

GIMLI
We cannot pass over the mountain. Let us
go under it. Let us go through the mines
of Moria.

SARUMAN
Moria. You fear to go into those mines,
don't you? The dwarves delved too
greedily and too deep.

SARUMAN
You know what they awoke in, the darkness
of Khazad-dum. Shadow and flame.

GANDALF
Let the ringbearer decide.

GANDALF
Frodo?

FRODO
We will go through the mines.

GANDALF
So be it.

STOP

GIMLI
The walls of Moria!

GANDALF
Ithildin. It mirrors only starlight and
moonlight.

GANDALF
It reads, "The door of Durin, Lord of
Moria. Speak, friend, and enter."

MERRY
What do you suppose that means?

GANDALF
It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
speak the password and the doors will
open.

GANDALF
Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!

ARAGORN
Mines are no place for a Pony, even one
so brave as Bill.

SAM
Bye, Bill.

ARAGORN
Go on, Bill, go on. Don't worry, Sam. He
knows his way home.

SAM
Goodbye, Bill.

ARAGORN
Do not disturb the water.

FRODO
It's a riddle.

FRODO
Speak, friend, and enter. What's the
Elvish for friend?

GANDALF
mellon.

STOP

GIMLI
So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled
hospitality of the dwarves; roaring
fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.
This, my friend, is the home of my
cousin, Balin, and they call this a
Mine. A mine!

BOROMIR
This is no mine. It's a tomb!

GIMLI
Oh no. No.No!

LEGOLAS
Goblins!

BOROMIR
We make for the Gap of Rohan.We should
never have come here.

GANDALF
Into the mines!

BOROMIR
Legolas!

GANDALF
We now have but one choice: We must face
the long dark of Moria. Be on your
guard! There are older and fouler things
than the Orcs in the deep places of the
world.

GANDALF
Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to
the other side. Let us hope that our
presence will go unnoticed.

STOP

GANDALF
I have no memory of this place.

PIPPIN
Are we lost?

MERRY
No. I don't think we are. Shhhh,
Gandalf's thinking.

PIPPIN
Merry!

MERRY
What?

PIPPIN
I'm hungry.

FRODO
There's something down there.

GANDALF
It's Gollum.

FRODO
Gollum!

GANDALF
He's been following us for three days.

FRODO
He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?

GANDALF
Escaped, or was set loose. And now the
Ring has drawn him here. He will never
be rid of his need for it. He hates and
loves the ring, as he hates and loves
himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story.

GANDALF
Yes, Smeagol he was once called. Before
the ring came to him, before it drove him
mad.

FRODO
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he
had the chance.

GANDALF
Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's
hand. Many that live deserve death, and
some that die deserve life. Can you give
it to them, Frodo?

GANDALF
Do not be too eager to deal out death in
judgment, even the very wise cannot see
all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum
has some part to play yet, for good or
ill, before this is over. The pity of
Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

FRODO
I wish the ring had never come to me.
I wish none of this had happened.

GANDALF
So do all who live to see such times, but
that is not for them to decide. All we
have to decide is what to do with the
time that is given to us.

GANDALF
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In
which case, you also were meant to have
it, and that is an encouraging thought.

GANDALF
Ah! That it's that way!

MERRY
He's remembered!

GANDALF
No, but the air doesn't smell so foul
down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose!

STOP

GANDALF
Let me risk a little more light.

GANDALF
Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city
of Dwarrowdelf!

SAM
Well, there's an eye opener and no
mistake!

GANDALF
Gimli!!

GIMLI
No. No - oh, no!

GANDALF
"Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of
Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I had
feared.

LEGOLAS
We must move on, we cannot linger.

GANDALF
"They have taken the Bridge and the
second hall: We have barred the
gates, but cannot hold them for
long. The ground shakes. Drums in the
deep. We cannot get out. A shadow moves
in the dark. Will no-one save us? They
are coming."

GANDALF
Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next
time and rid us of your stupidity!

SAM
Mister Frodo!

LEGOLAS
Orcs !

ARAGORN
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.

BOROMIR
They have a cave troll!

GIMLI
Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in
Moria who still draws breath!

STOP

SAM
He's alive!

FRODO
I'm alright. I'm not hurt.

ARAGORN
You should be dead. That spear would've
skewered a wild boar!

GANDALF
I think there's more to this hobbit than
meets the eye.

GIMLI
Mithril! You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

GANDALF
To the bridge of Khazad-dum!

GANDALF
This way!

STOP

BOROMIR
What is this new devilry?

GANDALF
A Balrog. A demon of the ancient world!
This foe is beyond any of you!
Run! Quickly!

GANDALF
Lead them on, Aragorn. The bridge is
near.

GANDALF
Do as I say; swords are no more use here.

STOP

GANDALF
Over the bridge! Fly!

GANDALF
You cannot pass!

FRODO
Gandalf!

GANDALF
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark
fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!

GANDALF
Go back to the shadow!

GANDALF
You shall not pass!

FRODO
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Fly, you fools!

FRODO
No!

ARAGORN
Gandalf!

STOP

ARAGORN
Legolas, get them up!

BOROMIR
Give them a moment for pity's sake!

ARAGORN
By nightfall these hills will be swarming
with Orcs! We must reach the woods of
Lothlorien. Come, Boromir, Legolas,
Gimli, get them up. On your feet, Sam.

ARAGORN
Frodo? Frodo!

STOP

GIMLI
Stay close, young hobbits. They say a
Sorceress lives in these woods. An elf-
witch of terrible power. All who look
upon her fall under her spell.

GALADRIEL
Frodo.

GIMLI
And are never seen again!

GALADRIEL
Your coming to us is as the footsteps
of doom. You bring great evil here,
Ringbearer.

SAM
Mister Frodo?

GIMLI
Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare
so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and
the ears of a fox!

HALDIR
The dwarf breathes so loud we could have
shot him in the dark.

ARAGORN
Haldir of Lorien, we come here for your
help. We need your protection.

GIMLI
Aragorn! These woods are perilous. We
should go back.

HALDIR
You have entered the realm of the Lady of
the Wood. You cannot go back.

HALDIR
Come, she is waiting.

STOP

CELEBORN
Eight there are, yet nine there were set
out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is
Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with
him.

GALADRIEL
He has fallen into shadow.

GALADRIEL
The Quest stands upon the edge of a
knife. Stray but a little and it will
fail, to the ruin of all. Yet hope
remains while the company is true.

GALADRIEL
Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go
now and rest for you are weary with
sorrow and much toil.

GALADRIEL
Tonight you will sleep in peace.
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire.

GALADRIEL
The one who has seen the eye.

STOP

LEGOLAS
A lament for Gandalf.

MERRY
What do they say about him?

LEGOLAS
I have not the heart to tell you. For me,
the grief is still too near.

ARAGORN
Take some rest. These borders are well
protected.

BOROMIR
I will find no rest here. I heard her
voice inside my head. She spoke of my
father and the fall of Gondor, and she
said to me: "Even now, there is hope left."
But I cannot see it! It is long since
we had any hope.

BOROMIR
My father is a noble man, but his rule is
failing and our - our people lose faith.
He looks to me to make things right. And
I would do it, I would see the glory of
Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it,
Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion,
glimmering like a spike of pearl and
silver, its banners caught high in the
morning breeze. Have you ever been
called home by the clear ringing of
silver trumpets?

ARAGORN
I have seen the white city, long ago.

BOROMIR
One day our paths will lead us there, and
the tower guards shall take up the call
"the Lords of Gondor have returned."

STOP

GALADRIEL
Will you look into the mirror?

FRODO
What will I see?

GALADRIEL
Even the wisest cannot tell for the
mirror shows many things: Things that
were. Things that are. And some things
that have not yet come to pass.

STOP

GALADRIEL
I know what it is you saw, for it is
also in my mind. It is the future,
Frodo. It is what will come to pass if
you should fail.

GALADRIEL
The fellowship is breaking. It has
already begun. He will try to take the
ring. You know of whom I speak. One by
one, it will destroy them all.

FRODO
If you ask it of me, I will give you the
One Ring.

GALADRIEL
You offer it to me freely! I do not deny
that my heart has greatly desired this.

GALADRIEL
In place of the Dark Lord, you would have
a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and
terrible as the Dawn! Treacherous as the
Sea! Stronger than the foundations of
the earth! All shall love me and
despair!

GALADRIEL
I pass the test.
I will diminish and go into the west and
remain Galadriel.

FRODO
I cannot do this alone.

GALADRIEL
You are the ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear
a ring of power is to be alone. This task
was appointed to you, and if you do not
find a way, no one will.

FRODO
Then I know what I must do. It's
just: I'm afraid to do it.

GALADRIEL
Even the smallest person can change the
course of the future.

STOP

SARUMAN
Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?

SARUMAN
They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark
Powers, tortured and mutilated. A
ruined and terrible form of life. And
now, perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai.
Whom do you serve?

LURTZ
Saruman.

SARUMAN
Hunt them down. Do not stop until they
are found. You do not know pain. You do
not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.

SARUMAN
One of the Halflings carries something of
great value. Bring him to me, alive and
unspoiled. Kill the others.

STOP

GALADRIEL
Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the
light of Earendil, our most beloved star.

GALADRIEL
May it be a light for you in dark places,
when all other lights go out.

STOP

ARAGORN
The Argonath.

ARAGORN
Long have I desired to look upon the
kings of old. My kin.

ARAGORN
We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
boats and continue on foot. We approach
Mordor from the North.

GIMLI
Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable
labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And
after that gets even better! A
festering, stinking marshland, far as the
eye can see.

ARAGORN
That is our Road. I suggest you take
some rest and recover your strength,
Master Dwarf.

GIMLI
Recover my-

LEGOLAS
We should leave now.

ARAGORN
No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We
must wait for cover of darkness.

LEGOLAS
It is not the Eastern shore that worries
me.

LEGOLAS
A shadow and a threat has been growing in
my mind. Something draws near, I can
feel it.

MERRY
Where's Frodo?

STOP

BOROMIR
None of us should wander alone; you least
of all. So much depends on you. Frodo?

BOROMIR
I know why you seek solitude. You
suffer, I see it day by day. Are you
sure you do not suffer needlessly?

BOROMIR
Let me help you. There are other ways,
Frodo, other paths that we might take.

FRODO
I know what you would say, and it would
seem like wisdom but for the warning of
my heart.

BOROMIR
Warning? Against what?

BOROMIR
We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that
fear drive us to destroy what hope we
have. Don't you see that is madness?

FRODO
There is no other way.

BOROMIR
I ask only for the strength to defend my
people.
If you would but lend me the ring-

FRODO
No!

BOROMIR
Why do you recoil? I am no thief.

FRODO
You are not yourself.

BOROMIR
What chance do you think you have? They
will find you, they will take the ring
and you will beg for death before the
end.

BOROMIR
You fool! It is not yours save by
unhappy chance! It might have been mine.
It should be mine. Give it to me! Give
me the ring!

BOROMIR
I see your mind. You will take the ring
to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to
your death - and the death of us all!

BOROMIR
Curse you! Curse you and your Halflings!

BOROMIR
Frodo! Frodo! What have I done. Please,
Frodo.

BOROMIR
I'm sorry, Frodo. Frodo-

STOP

ARAGORN
Frodo?

FRODO
It has taken Boromir.

ARAGORN
Where is the ring?

FRODO
Stay away!

ARAGORN
Frodo...I swore to protect you.

FRODO
Can you protect me from yourself?

FRODO
Would you destroy it?

ARAGORN
I would have gone with you to the end...
into the very fires of Mordor.

FRODO
I know...Look after the others,
especially Sam...he will not understand.

ARAGORN
Go, Frodo!

ARAGORN
Run! Run!!

STOP

MERRY
Frodo!

MERRY
Hide here, quick!

PIPPIN
Come on...

PIPPIN
What's he doing?

MERRY
He's leaving.

PIPPIN
No!

MERRY
Pippin!

STOP

LEGOLAS
The horn of Gondor!

ARAGORN
Boromir!

BOROMIR
Run! Run!

MERRY & PIPPIN
Boromir! Boromir!

STOP

BOROMIR
They took the little ones...

BOROMIR
Frodo...where is Frodo?

ARAGORN
I let Frodo go.

BOROMIR
Then you did what I could not. I tried
to take the ring from him.

ARAGORN
The ring is beyond our reach now.

BOROMIR
Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed
you all.

ARAGORN
No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You
have kept your honor.

BOROMIR
Leave it! It is over...the world of Men
will fall and all will come to darkness
and my city to ruin..Aragorn..

ARAGORN
I do not know what strength is in my
blood, but I swear to you: I will not
let the White City fall, nor your people
fail...

BOROMIR
Our people...our people...

BOROMIR
I would have followed you, my
brother...my captain, my King.

ARAGORN
Be at peace, son of Gondor.

ARAGORN
They will look for his coming from the
white tower...but he will not return.

STOP

SAM
Mister Frodo!

SAM
Not alone, Frodo. Mister Frodo!

FRODO
No, Sam.

FRODO
Go back, Sam. I'm going to Mordor alone.

SAM
Of course you are...and I'm coming with
you!

FRODO
You can't swim.

FRODO
Sam!

SAM
I made a promise, Mister Frodo...a promise.
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to...I don't mean to.

FRODO
Oh, Sam!

FRODO
Come on then..

STOP

LEGOLAS
If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and
Sam before nightfall.

LEGOLAS
You mean not to follow them...

ARAGORN
Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

GIMLI
Then it has all been in vain...the
fellowship has failed.

ARAGORN
Not if we hold true to each other. We
will not abandon Merry and Pippin to
torment and death, not while we have
strength left.

ARAGORN
Leave all that can be spared behind...

ARAGORN
We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.

GIMLI
Yes! Ha!

STOP

FRODO
Mordor! I hope the others find a safer
road.

SAM
Strider'll look after them.

FRODO
I don't suppose we'll ever see them
again.

SAM
We may yet, Mister Frodo. We may.

FRODO
Sam?

FRODO
I'm glad you're with me.

STOP

SAM
What is it, Mr Frodo?

FRODO
Nothing. Just a dream.

SAM
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don’t want to see any closer, and
the one place we’re trying to get to.
It’s just where we can’t get. Let’s
face it, Mr Frodo, we’re lost. I don’t
think Gandalf meant for us to come this
way.

FRODO
He didn’t mean for a lot of things to
happen, Sam, but they did.

SAM
Mr Frodo? It’s the Ring, isn’t it?

FRODO
It’s getting heavier.

FRODO
What food have we got left?

SAM
Well, let me see. Oh yes, lovely! Lembas bread.
And look! More lembas bread.

SAM
I don't usually hold with foreign food,
but this Elvish stuff, it’s not bad.

FRODO
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?

SAM
Those rain clouds might.

SAM
This looks strangely familiar.

FRODO
It’s because we’ve been here before!
We’re going in circles.

SAM
Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant
there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you
smell it?

FRODO
Yes. I can smell it. We’re not alone.

STOP

GOLLUM
The thieves! The thieves! The filthy
little thieves! Where is it? Where isss
it? They stole it from us. My preciousss.
Curse them! We hates them!
It’s ours, it is! And we wantssss it!

FRODO
This is Sting. You’ve seen it before, haven’t you, Gollum!
Release him or I’ll cut your throat!

STOP

GOLLUM
It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty
Elves twisted it. Take it off us!

SAM
Quiet you!

SAM
It’s hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor’s
going to hear this racket! Let’s just
tie him up and leave him.

GOLLUM
No! That would kill us! Kill us!

SAM
It’s no more than you deserve!

FRODO
Maybe he does deserve to die, but now
that I see him, I do pity him.

GOLLUM
We be nice to them if they
be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears
to do what you wants. We swears.

FRODO
There’s no promise you can make that
I can trust.

GOLLUM
We swears to serve the master of the
preciousss. We swears on - on the precious.
*Gollum, Gollum*

FRODO
The Ring is treacherous. It will hold
you to your word.

GOLLUM
Yes, on the preciousss. On the preciousss.

SAM
I don’t believe you!
Get down! I said, down!

FRODO
Sam!

SAM
He’s trying to trick us! We let him
go he’ll throttle us in our sleep!

FRODO
You know the way to Mordor?

GOLLUM
Yes.

FRODO
You’ve been there before?

GOLLUM
Yes.

FRODO
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

STOP

Merry. Merry!

UGLÚK
What is it? What do you smell?

MAN-FLESH URUK
Man-flesh.

PIPPIN
Aragorn!

UGLÚK
They've picked up our trail! Let's move!

ARAGORN
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent. Hurry!

LEGOLAS
Come on, Gimli!

GIMLI
Three days’ and nights’ pursuit. No food.
No rest. And no sign of our quarry but
what bare rock can tell.

ARAGORN
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

LEGOLAS
They may yet be alive.

ARAGORN
Less than a day ahead of us. Come!

LEGOLAS
Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!

GIMLI
I am wasted on cross-country!
We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very
dangerous over short distances!

ARAGORN
Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There
is something strange at work here. Some
evil gives speed to these creatures,
sets its will against us.

ARAGORN
Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?

LEGOLAS
The Uruks turn northeast. They’re taking
the hobbits to Isengard!

ARAGORN
Saruman.

STOP

SARUMAN
The world is changing. Who now
has the strength to stand against the
armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand
against the might of Sauron and Saruman
and the union of the two towers?

SARUMAN
Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule
this Middle-earth.

SARUMAN
The old world will burn in the fires
of industry. The forests will fall.
A new order will rise. We will drive
the machine of war with the sword and
the spear and the iron fists of the
Orc. We have only to remove those who
oppose us.

STOP

SARUMAN
The horsemen took your land. They drove
your people into the hills to scratch
a living off rocks.

DUNLAND MAN
Murderers!

SARUMAN
Take back the lands they stole from
you! Burn every village!

DUNLAND CROWD
Argh!

SARUMAN
It will begin in Rohan. Too long have
these peasants stood against you. But
no more.

STOP

MORWEN
Éothain! Éothain! You take your sister.
You’ll go faster with just two.

FREDA
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf,
he is too big for him!

MORWEN
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm. Do you understand
me?

ÉOTHAIN
Yes, Ma!

FREDA
I don’t wanna leave!
I don't wanna go, Mama!

MORWEN
Freda, I will find you there.

MORWEN
Quickly!

MORWEN
Go child!

SARUMAN
Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall.

STOP

EOWYN
Théodred!

EOWYN
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

EOMER
He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don’t
defend our country, Saruman will take
it by force.

GRIMA
That is a lie!
Saruman the White has ever been our
friend and ally.

THEODEN
Grima, Grima.
My son? Grima?

EOMER
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at
will. Orcs bearing the white hand of
Saruman.

GRIMA
Why do you lay these troubles on an
already troubled mind. Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent,
your war-mongering.

EOMER
War-mongering?

EOMER
How long is it since Saruman bought
you? What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the men are dead you will take
your share of the treasure?

EOMER
Too long have you watched my sister,
too long have you haunted her steps.

GRIMA
You see much Eomer, Son of Éomund. Too
much. You are banished forthwith from the
kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death!

EOMER
Argh!

STOP

GIMLI
Keep breathing! That’s the key! Breathe!
Ho!

LEGOLAS
They’ve run as if the very whips of
their masters were behind them.

We’re not going no further till we’ve
had a breather!

Get a fire going!

Merry! Merry!

MERRY
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

PIPPIN
What’s making that noise?

MERRY
It’s the trees.

PIPPIN
What?

MERRY
Do you remember the Old Forest? On the
borders of Buckland? Folk used to say
that there was something in the water
that made the trees grow tall, and
come alive.

PIPPIN
Alive?

MERRY
Trees that could whisper. Talk to each
other. Even move.

MAÚHUR
I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' but
maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!

SNAGA
Yeah. Why can’t we have some meat?
What about them? They’re fresh.

UGLÚK
They are not for eating!

GRISHNÁKH
What about their legs? They don't need
those. Ooh! Hey look tasty!

UGLÚK
Get back, scum!

MORDOR ORC
Carve them up!

SNAGA
Just a mouth full.

UGLÚK
No!

UGLÚK
Looks like meat’s back on the menu,
boys!

MERRY
Pippin, let’s go.

GRISHNÁKH
Go on, call for help. Squeal!
No one’s gonna save you now!

MERRY
Pippin!

PIPPIN
ARGH!

STOP

LEGOLAS
A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night.

ARAGORN
Riders of Rohan, what news from the
Mark?

EOMER
What business does an Elf, a man and
a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak
quickly!

GIMLI
Give me your name, Horsemaster, and
I shall give you mine.

EOMER
I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if
it stood but a little higher from the
ground.

LEGOLAS
You would die before your stroke fell!

ARAGORN
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This
is Gimli, son of Glóin and Legolas of
the Woodland realm. We are friends of
Rohan and of Theoden, your king.

EOMER
Theoden no longer recognizes friend
from foe. Not even
his own kin.

EOMER
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the
king and claimed lordship over these
lands. My company are those loyal to
Rohan. And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning. He walks
here and there, they say, as an old
man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere
his spies slip past our nets.

ARAGORN
We are not spies. We track a party of
Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They’ve taken two of our friends captive.

EOMER
The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered
them during the night.

GIMLI
But there were two hobbits. Did you
see two hobbits with them?

ARAGORN
They would be small – only children
to your eyes.

EOMER
We left none alive. We piled the carcasses
and burned them.

GIMLI
Dead?

EOMER
I am sorry.

EOMER
Hasufel! Arod!
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters. Farewell.

EOMER
Look for your friends. But do not trust
to hope, it has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!

STOP

GIMLI
It’s one of their wee belts.

LEGOLAS
Hiro îth, ab 'wanath.
(May they find peace in death)

ARAGORN
AAARRGGHH! *breaks his toe*

GIMLI
We failed them.

ARAGORN
A hobbit lay here, and the other.
They crawled.

ARAGORN
Their hands were bound. Their bonds
were cut.

ARAGORN
They ran over here. They were followed.

ARAGORN
The tracks lead away from the battle!
Into Fangorn Forest.

GIMLI
Fangorn. What madness drove them in
there?

STOP

PIPPIN
Did we lose him? I think
we lost him.

GRISHNÁKH
I’m gonna rip out your filthy little
innards! Come here!

MERRY
Trees! Climb a tree!

MERRY
He's gone.

PIPPIN
Merry!

TREEBEARD
Hooooo.

PIPPIN
Argh!

GRISHNÁKH
Let’s put a maggot-hole in your belly.

PIPPIN
Run, Merry!

TREEBEARD
Little Orcs! Burárum!

PIPPIN
It’s talking, Merry. The tree is talking!

TREEBEARD
Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent.

MERRY
A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.

PIPPIN
Don’t talk to it, Merry. Don’t encourage
it.

TREEBEARD
Treebeard, some call me.

PIPPIN
And whose side are you on?

TREEBEARD
Side? I am on nobody’s side because
nobody’s on my side, little Orc. Nobody
cares for the woods anymore.

MERRY
We’re not Orcs. We’re Hobbits!

TREEBEARD
Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire, they come with
axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking,
burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse
them!

MERRY
No, you don’t understand. We’re Hobbits!
Halflings! Shirefolk!

TREEBEARD
Maybe you are and maybe you aren’t.
The White Wizard will know.

PIPPIN
The White Wizard?

MERRY
Saruman.

STOP

GOLLUM
See, see, we have led you out! Hurry
hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find
you.

SAM
Whoa, it’s a bog! He’s led us into a
swamp!

GOLLUM
A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We
will take you on safe paths through
the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go
quickly.

GOLLUM
I found it, I did. The way through the
marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't
know it. They go round for miles and
miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick
as shadows we must be.

SAM
There are dead things! Dead faces in
the water!

GOLLUM
All dead. All rotten. Elves and men
and orcses. A great battle long ago.
The Dead Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name.
This way. Don’t follow the lights.

SAM
Ohh!

GOLLUM
Careful now, or hobbits go down to join
the dead ones and light little candles
of their own.

STOP

SAM
Frodo!

FRODO
Gollum-

GOLLUM
Don’t follow the lights!

SAM
Mr Frodo! Are you alright?

STOP

GOLLUM
Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful. Our preciousss.

FRODO
What did you say?

GOLLUM
Master should be resting. Master needs
to keep up his strength.

FRODO
Who are you?

GOLLUM
Mustn’t ask us. Not its business. *Gollum,
Gollum*

FRODO
Gandalf told me you were one of the
River Folk.

GOLLUM
Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold
be travellers far from home.

FRODO
He said your life was a sad story.

GOLLUM
They do not see what lies ahead, when
sun has failed and moon is dead.

FRODO
You were not so very different from
a hobbit once, were you, Smeagol?

GOLLUM
What did you call me?

FRODO
That was your name once, wasn’t it?
A long time ago.

GOLLUM
My name. My name. S-Smeagol!

GOLLUM
Argh!

SAM
Black Riders!

GOLLUM
Hide! Hide!

FRODO
Argh!

SAM
C’mon Frodo! C'mon!

GOLLUM
Quick! They will see us! They will see
us!

SAM
I thought they were dead!

GOLLUM
Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.

GOLLUM
Wraiths! Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it. They are calling
for the preciousss.

SAM
Mr Frodo! It’s alright. I’m here.

GOLLUM
Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very
close.

STOP

GIMLI
*spits out* Orc blood.

ARAGORN
These are strange tracks.

GIMLI
The air is so close in here.

LEGOLAS
This forest is old. Very old. Full of
memory and anger.

LEGOLAS
The trees are speaking to each other.

ARAGORN
Gimli!
Lower your axe.

LEGOLAS
Aragorn, nad nâ ennas! (Something is
out there.)

ARAGORN
Man cenich? (What do you see?)

LEGOLAS
The White Wizard approaches.

ARAGORN
Do not let him speak. He will put a
spell on us.

ARAGORN
We must be quick.

STOP

WHITE WIZARD
You are tracking the footsteps of two
young hobbits.

ARAGORN
Where are they?

WHITE WIZARD
They passed this way the day before
yesterday. They met someone they did
not expect. Does that comfort you?

ARAGORN
Who are you? Show yourself!

ARAGORN
It cannot be. You fell.

GANDALF
Through fire and water. From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak, I fought with the
Balrog of Morgoth.

GANDALF
Until at last, I threw down my enemy
and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.

GANDALF
Darkness took me. And I strayed out
of thought and time. Stars wheeled
overhead and everyday was as long as
a life-age of the earth. But it was
not the end. I felt life in me again.

GANDALF
I've been sent back until my task is
done.

ARAGORN
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Gandalf? Yes- That's what they used
to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was
my name.

GIMLI
Gandalf!

GANDALF
I am Gandalf
the White. And I come
back to you now at the turn of the tide.

STOP

GANDALF
One stage of your journey is over, another
begins. War has come to Rohan. We must
ride to Edoras with all speed.

LEGOLAS
That is one of the Mearas, unless my
eyes are cheated by some spell.

GANDALF
Shadowfax.
He's the lord of all horses and he's
been my friend through many dangers.

STOP

TREEBEARD
My home lies deep in the forest near
the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf
I would keep you safe and safe is where
I’ll keep you. The trees have grown
wild and dangerous. Anger festers in
their hearts. They will harm you if
they can. There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

STOP

GOLLUM
The Black Gate of Mordor.

SAM
Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing
or two to say if he could see us now.

GOLLUM
Master says to show him the way into
Mordor, so good Smeagol does. Master
says so.

FRODO
I did.

SAM
That’s it then. We cannot get past that.

SAM
Look! The gate, it's opening! I can
see a way down.

FRODO
Sam, no!

SAM
Argh!

GOLLUM
Master!

STOP

FRODO
I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.

SAM
I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these
Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.

FRODO
Now!

GOLLUM
No! No, no master! They catch you! They
catch you! Don’t take it to him! He
wants the preciousss. Always he’s looking
for it! And the preciousss is wanting
to go back to him. But we mustn’t let
him have it.

GOLLUM
No! There’s
another way. More secret. A dark way.

SAM
Why haven’t you spoken of this before?!

GOLLUM
Because Master did not ask!

SAM
He’s up to something.

FRODO
Are you saying there’s another way into
Mordor?

GOLLUM
Yes. There is a path, and some stairs,
and then, a tunnel.

FRODO
He’s led us this far, Sam.

SAM
Mr Frodo, no.

FRODO
He’s been true to his word.

SAM
No!

FRODO
Lead the way, Smeagol.

GOLLUM
Good Smeagol always helps.

STOP

GANDALF
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan,
whose mind is overthrown. Saruman’s
hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

EOWYN
My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord?
Uncle?

EOWYN
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?

GANDALF
Be careful what you say. Do not look
for welcome here.

GRIMA
Oh, he must have died sometime in
the night. What a tragedy for the king
to lose his only son and heir.

GRIMA
I understand his passing is hard to
accept, especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

EOWYN
Leave me alone, snake!

GRIMA
Oh, but you are alone! Who
knows what you have spoken to the darkness.
In bitter watches of the night, when
all your life seems to shrink, the walls
of your bower closing in about you,
like a hutch to trammel some wild thing
in.

GRIMA
So fair, so cold, like a morning of
pale spring still clinging to winter's
chill.

EOWYN
Your words are poison!

STOP

GIMLI
You’ll find more cheer in a graveyard.

HAMA
I cannot allow you before Theoden-King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order
of Grima Wormtongue.

HAMA
Your staff.

GANDALF
Hmm? Oh. You
would not part an old man from his walking
stick?

GRIMA
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He’s a herald of woe.

GANDALF
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat
lessened of late. Theoden King.

GRIMA
(whispering) He’s not welcome.

THEODEN
Why should I welcome you - Gandalf Stormcrow?

GRIMA
A just question, my liege. Late is the hour in
which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news
is an ill guest.

GANDALF
Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind
you teeth. I have not passed through
fire and death to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm!

GRIMA
His staff! I told
you to take the wizard’s staff!

GANDALF
Theoden, son of Thengel, too long have
you sat in the shadows.

GIMLI
I would stay still, if I were
you.

GANDALF
Hearken to me! I release you from the
spell.

THEODEN
Hahahhhahahahah! You have
no power here, Gandalf the Grey!
Argh!

GANDALF
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison
is drawn from a wound.

THEODEN
If I go, Theoden dies.

GANDALF
You did not kill me, you will not kill
him!

THEODEN
Rohan is mine!

GANDALF
Be gone!

STOP

THEODEN
I know your face. Eowyn - Eowyn!

THEODEN
Gandalf?

GANDALF
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

THEODEN
Dark have been my dreams of late.

GANDALF
Your fingers would remember their old
strength better, if they grasped your
sword.

GRIMA
Argh! I've only ever served you, my lord!

THEODEN
Your leechcraft
would have had me crawling on all fours
like a beast!

GRIMA
Send me not from your side.

ARAGORN
No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilled on his
account.

GRIMA
Get out of my way!

HAMA
Hail, Theoden king!

THEODEN
Where is Théodred? Where is my son?

STOP

THEODEN
Simbelmynë. Ever has it grown on the
tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas, that these evil days should be
mine. The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days
of my house.

GANDALF
Théodred’s death was not of your making.

THEODEN
No parent should have to bury their
child.

GANDALF
He was strong in life. His spirit will
find its way to the halls of your fathers.
Westu hál. Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu. (Be-thou
well. Go-thou, Théodred, go-thou.)

STOP

EOWYN
They had no warning. They were unarmed.
Now the wildmen are moving through the
Westfold, burning as they go. Rick,
cot and tree.

FREDA
Where’s mama?

EOWYN
Shh.

GANDALF
This is but a taste of the terror that
Saruman will unleash. All the more potent
for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on. Draw
him away from your women and children.
You must fight.

ARAGORN
You have two thousand good men riding
north as we speak. Eomer is loyal to
you. His men will return and fight for
their king.

THEODEN
They will be three hundred leagues from
here by now. Eomer cannot help us. I
know what it is that you want of me.
But I will not bring further death to
my people. I will not risk open war.

ARAGORN
Open war is upon you. Whether you would
risk it or not.

THEODEN
When last I looked, Theoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

GANDALF
Then what is the king’s decision?

STOP

HAMA
By order of the king, the city must
empty. We make for the refuge of Helm’s
Deep. Do not burden yourselves with
treasures. Take only what provisions
you need.

GIMLI
Helm’s Deep! They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight. Who
will defend them if not their king?

ARAGORN
He’s only doing what he thinks is best
for his people. Helm’s Deep has saved
them in the past.

GANDALF
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap. He thinks
he’s leading them to safety. What they
will get is a massacre. Theoden has
a strong will but I fear for him. I
fear for the survival of Rohan. He will
need you before the end, Aragorn. The
people of Rohan will need you. The defences
HAVE to hold.

ARAGORN
They will hold.

GANDALF
The Grey Pilgrim, that’s what they
used to call me. Three hundred lives
of men I’ve walked this earth and now
I have no time. With luck, my search
will not be in vain. Look to my coming
at first light on the fifth day. At
dawn, look to the East.

ARAGORN
Go.

STOP

ARAGORN
You have some skill with a blade.

EOWYN
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords may still die upon
them. I fear neither death nor pain.

ARAGORN
What do you fear, my lady?

EOWYN
A cage. To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them and all chance
of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.

ARAGORN
You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden
of Rohan. I
do not think that would be your fate.

STOP

GRIMA
Theoden will not stay at Edoras. It’s
vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect
an attack on the city. They will flee
to Helm’s Deep, the great fortress of
Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains. They will be
slow. They will have women and children
with them.

SARUMAN
Send out your warg riders.

STOP

SAM
Hey Stinker! Don’t go getting too far
ahead!

FRODO
Why do you do that?

SAM
What?

FRODO
Call him names; run him down all the
time.

SAM
Because - because that's what he is,
Mr Frodo. There's naught left in 'im
but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he
wants. It's all he cares about.

FRODO
You have no idea what
it did to him. What it’s still doing
to him.
I want to help him, Sam.

SAM
Why?

FRODO
Because I have to believe he can come
back.

SAM
You can’t save him, Mr Frodo.

FRODO
What do you know about
it? Nothing!

FRODO
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't
know why I said that.

SAM
I do. It's the Ring. You can't
take your eyes off it. I've seen you.
You're not eating. You barely sleep.
It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo.
You have to fight it!

FRODO
I know what I have
to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to
me! It's my task! Mine! My own!

SAM
Can’t you hear yourself? Don’t you know
who you sound like?

STOP

GOLLUM
We wants it. We needs it. Must have
the precioussss. They stole it from
us. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked,
trickssssy, falssse!

SMEAGOL
No! Not Master.

GOLLUM
Yes, precious. False. They will cheat
you, hurt you, lie.

SMEAGOL
Master’s my friend.

GOLLUM
You don’t have any friends.
Nobody likes YOU!

SMEAGOL
Not listening. I’m
not listening.

GOLLUM
You’re a liar and a thief.

SMEAGOL
Nope.

GOLLUM
Murderer!

SMEAGOL
Go away.

GOLLUM
Go away?
HAHAHAHA!

SMEAGOL
I hate you. I hate you!

GOLLUM
Where would you be without
me? *Gollum, Gollum*. I saved us. It
was me. We survived because of me!

SMEAGOL
Not anymore.

GOLLUM
What did you say?

SMEAGOL
Master looks after us now. We don’t
need you.

GOLLUM
What?

SMEAGOL
Leave now and never come back.

GOLLUM
No!

SMEAGOL
Leave now and never come back!

GOLLUM
Arrrgh!

SMEAGOL
LEAVE NOW AND NEVER COME BACK!

SMEAGOL
We- we told him to go away! And away
he goes, preciousss. Gone,
gone, gone! Smeagol is free!

STOP

SMEAGOL
Look! Look! See what Smeagol finds!
Hehehe! Hahaha!

SMEAGOL
They are young. They are tender. They
are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat
them!

SAM
You’ll make him sick, you will, behaving
like that!
There’s only one way to eat a brace
of coneys.

STOP

SMEAGOL
Argh! What’s it doing!
Stupid fat hobbit! It ruins it!

SAM
What’s to ruin? There’s hardly any meat
on ‘em.

SAM
What we need is a few good taters.

GOLLUM
What’s taters, preciousss? What’s taters
uh?

SAM
PO-TAY-TOES! Boil ‘em. Mash ‘em. Stick
‘em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

SMEAGOL
Pbbbttt!

SAM
Even you couldn’t say no to that.

SMEAGOL
Oh yes we could! Spoil nice fish!
Give it to usss rrraw - and wrrriggling!
You keep nasty chips.

SAM
You’re hopeless.

STOP

SAM
Who are they?

GOLLUM
Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They
are called to Mordor. The Dark One is
gathering all armies to him. It won’t
be long now. He will soon be ready.

SAM
Ready to do what?

GOLLUM
To make his war. The last war that will
cover all the world in shadow.

FRODO
We’ve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

SAM
Mr Frodo!
Look! It’s an Oliphaunt!

SAM
No one at home will believe this.

FRODO
Smeagol?

FRODO
We’ve lingered here too long. Come on,
Sam!

SAM
Ah!

FARAMIR
Bind their hands.

STOP

GIMLI
It’s true you don’t see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice
and appearance, *laughs* that they’re often
mistaken for Dwarf men!

ARAGORN
(whispering) It’s the beards!

GIMLI
And this, in turn, has given rise to
the belief that there are no Dwarf women.
And that dwarves just spring out of
holes in the ground!

EOWYN
Hahahaha!

GIMLI
Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous!
Whoa!

EOWYN
Ooh!

GIMLI
It’s alright,
it’s alright. Nobody panic. That was
deliberate. It was deliberate.

STOP

ARWEN (V.O.)
The light of the Evenstar does not wax
and wane. It is mine to give to whom
I will, like my heart. Go to sleep.

ARAGORN
I am asleep. This is a dream.

ARWEN
Then it is a good dream. Sleep.

ARAGORN
Min lû pennich nin i aur hen telitha.

come.)

ARWEN

That is your path.)

trust this. Trust us.)

STOP

ELROND
Our time here is ending. Arwen’s time
is ending. Let her go. Let her take
the ship into the west. Let her bear
away her love for you to the Undying
Lands. There it will be evergreen.

ARAGORN
But never more than a memory.

ELROND
I will not leave my daughter here to
die.

ARAGORN
She stays because she still has hope.

ELROND
She stays for YOU! She belongs with
her people!

ARAGORN
Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae o

for another life. Away from war - grief -
despair.)

ARWEN
Why are you saying this?

ARAGORN
I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was
a dream, Arwen, nothing more.

ARAGORN
This belongs to you.

ARWEN
It was a gift. Keep it.

STOP

EOWYN
Where is she? The woman who gave you
that jewel.

EOWYN
My lord?

ARAGORN
She is sailing to the Undying Lands,
with all that is left of her kin.

GAMLING
What is it? Hama?

HAMA
I’m not sure.

GAMLING
Wargs!

LEGOLAS
Argh! A scout!

THEODEN
What is it? What do you see?

ARAGORN
Wargs! We
are under attack!

ARAGORN
Get them out of here!

THEODEN
All riders to the head of the column!

GIMLI
Come on, get
me up here, I’m a rider!

THEODEN
You must lead the people
to Helm’s Deep. And make haste!

EOWYN
I can fight!

THEODEN
No! You must do this. For me.

THEODEN
Follow me! Yah!

GIMLI
Forward.
I mean, charge forward! March forward!
That’s it! Go on!

EOWYN
Make for the lower
ground! Stick together!

WARG-RIDERS
Argh!

THEODEN
CHARGE!

GIMLI
Bring your pretty face to my axe!

GIMLI
That one counts as mine!

GIMLI
Stinking creature. Argh!

STOP

GIMLI
Tell me
what happened and I will ease your passing.

SHARKU
He’s dead. Took
a little tumble off the cliff.

LEGOLAS
You lie!

THEODEN
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.

THEODEN
Come.

STOP

REFUGEES
Helm’s Deep! At last! There it is!

OLD WOMAN
We’re safe, my lady! Thank
you!

FREDA
Mama!

MORWEN
Éothain! Freda!

GAMLING
Make way for Theoden!
Make way for the king!

EOWYN
So few. So few of you
have returned.

THEODEN
Our people are safe. We
have paid for it with many lives.

GIMLI
My lady.

EOWYN
Lord Aragorn, where is he?

GIMLI
He fell.

STOP

THEODEN
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate, and set a watch on the
surround.

GAMLING
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

THEODEN
Get them into the caves. Saruman's
arm would have grown long indeed if
he thinks he can reach us here.

STOP

GRIMA
Helm’s Deep has one weakness. Its outer
wall is solid rock but for a small culvert
at its base which is little more than
a drain.

GRIMA
How? How can fire undo stone? What kind
of device could bring down the wall?

SARUMAN
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep
will fall.

GRIMA
Even if it is breached,
it would take a number beyond reckoning,
thousands to storm the keep.

SARUMAN
Tens of thousands.

GRIMA
But, my lord, there is no such force.

SARUMAN
A new power is rising. Its victory is
at hand!

SARUMAN
This night, the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms
Deep! Leave none alive!

SARUMAN
To war!

SARUMAN
There will be no dawn for Men.

STOP

PIPPIN
Look! There’s smoke to the south!

TREEBEARD
There is always smoke rising from Isengard
these days.

MERRY
Isengard?

TREEBEARD
There was a time when Saruman would
walk in my woods. But now he has a mind
of metal and wheels. He no longer cares
for growing things.

PIPPIN
What is it?

MERRY
It’s Saruman’s army! The war has started.

STOP

ARWEN
May the grace
of the Valar protect you.

ARAGORN
Brego-

STOP

ELROND
Arwen.

ELROND
Tollen i lû. I chair gwannar na Valannor.
Si bado, no círar. (Arwen, it is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go
now, before it is too late.)

ARWEN
I have made my choice.

ELROND
He is not coming back. Why do you linger
here when there is no hope?

ARWEN
There is still hope.

ELROND
If Aragorn survives this war, you will
still be parted. If Sauron is defeated,
and Aragorn made king and all that you
hope for comes true, you will still
have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay
of time, Aragorn will die.

ELROND
And there will be no comfort for you.
No comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death, an image of the
splendor of the kings of men in glory
undimmed before the breaking of the
world.

ELROND
But you, my daughter, you will linger
on in darkness and in doubt. As nightfall
in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell, bound to your grief,
under the fading trees, until all the
world is changed and the long years
of your life are utterly spent.

ELROND
Arwen. There is
nothing for you here, only death.

ELROND
A im, ú-'erin veleth lîn?

ARWEN
Gerich meleth nîn, ada.

I feel it in the water, I feel it in
the earth, I smell it in the air.)

GALADRIEL
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy
the people of Rohan. Isengard has been unleashed.
The eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last
free kingdom of men.

GALADRIEL
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close. The strength
of the Ringbearer is failing. In his
heart, Frodo begins to understand. The quest will claim his
life. You know this. You have foreseen
it. It is the risk we all took.

GALADRIEL
In the gathering dark, the will of the
Ring grows strong. It works hard now
to find its way back into the hands
of men.

GALADRIEL
Men, who are so easily seduced by its
power. The young captain of Gondor has
but to extend his hands, take the Ring
for his own and the world will fall.
It is close now, so close to achieving
its goal.

GALADRIEL (V.O.)
For Sauron will have dominion of all
life on this Earth, even unto the ending
of the world. The time of the Elves
is over.

GALADRIEL (V.O.)
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?

STOP

FARAMIR
What news?

MADRIL
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked
Rohan. Theoden’s people have fled to
Helm’s Deep. But
we must look to our own borders. Faramir,
Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling
an army. Easterlings and Southrons are
passing through the Black Gate.

FARAMIR
How many?

MADRIL
Some thousands. More come every day.

FARAMIR
Who’s covering the river to the north?

MADRIL
We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but
if the city is attacked, we won’t hold
it.

FARAMIR
Saruman attacks
from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The
fight will come to men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us
soon. And he will strike hard. He knows
now we do not have the strength to repel
him.

FARAMIR
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

SAM
Spies?! Now wait just a minute!

FARAMIR
Well if you’re not spies, then who are
you?

FARAMIR
Speak.

FRODO
We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins
is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.

FARAMIR
Your bodyguard?

SAM
His gardener.

FARAMIR
And where is your skulking friend? That
gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured
look.

FRODO
There was no other.

FRODO
We set out from Rivendell with seven
companions. One we lost in Mória. Two
were my kin. A Dwarf there was also,
and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son
of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

FARAMIR
You’re a friend of Boromir?

FRODO
Yes - for my part.

FARAMIR
It will grieve you then to learn that
he is dead.

FRODO
Dead? How? When?

FARAMIR
As one of his companions, I’d hoped
you would tell me. He was my
brother.

GONDORIAN RANGER
Captain Faramir. We found
the third one.

FARAMIR
You must come with me. Now.

STOP

FARAMIR
Down there.

FARAMIR
To enter the forbidden pool bears the
penalty of death. They wait for
my command.

FARAMIR
Shall I shoot?

GOLLUM
The rock and pool is nice
and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish
to catch a fish , so juicy sweet!

FRODO
Wait! This creature
is bound to me. And I to him. He is
our guide. Please, let me go down to
him.

STOP

FRODO
Smeagol. Master is here. Come, Smeagol.
Trust master. Come!

GOLLUM
We must go now?

FRODO
Smeagol, you must trust master. Follow
me, come on. Come. Come, Smeagol. Nice
Smeagol. That’s it. Come on.

FRODO
Don’t hurt him! Smeagol don’t struggle!
Smeagol listen to me!

GOLLUM
Master!
No! No!

STOP

FARAMIR
Where are you leading them? Answer me!

GOLLUM
Sméa-gol. Why does it cry, Smeagol?

SMEAGOL
Cruel men hurts us. Master trickst us.

GOLLUM
Of course he did. I told you he was
tricksy. I told you he was false.

SMEAGOL
Master is our friend. Our friend!

GOLLUM
Master betrayed us.

SMEAGOL
No, not its business. Leave us alone!

GOLLUM
Filthy little hobbitses.
They stole it from us.

SMEAGOL
No. No!

FARAMIR
What did they steal?

GOLLUM
Myyy - PRECIOUSSS!
Aaaarrrggghhh!

STOP

SAM
We have to get out of here. You go.
Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring,
Mr Frodo. Just this once. Put it on.
Disappear.

FRODO
I can’t. You were right, Sam. You tried
to tell me, but - I’m sorry. The Ring’s
taking me Sam. If I put it on, he’ll
find me. He’ll see.

FARAMIR
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the wild I have you. Two halflings
and a host of men at my call. The Ring
of power within my grasp.

FARAMIR
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

FRODO
No!

SAM
Stop it! Leave him alone! Don’t you
understand? He’s got to destroy it.
That’s where we’re going. Into Mordor.
To the mountain of fire.

DAMROD
Osgiliath is under attack. They call
for reinforcements.

SAM
Please. It’s such a burden. Will you
not help him?

DAMROD
Captain?

FARAMIR
Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to
Gondor.

STOP

He’s alive!

canniest and the most reckless man I

ARAGORN
Gimli, where is the king?

LEGOLAS
Le ab-dollen. (You’re late.) You look terrible.

ARAGORN
Hannon le. (Thank you.)

THEODEN
A great host, you say?

ARAGORN
All Isengard is emptied

THEODEN
How many?

ARAGORN
Ten thousand strong at least.

THEODEN
Ten thousand?!

ARAGORN
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
to destroy the world of men. They will
be here by nightfall.

THEODEN
Let them come!

THEODEN
I want every man and strong
lad able to bear arms to be ready for
battle by nightfall.

THEODEN
We will cover the causeway and the gate
from above. No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall or set foot inside
the Hornburg.

GIMLI
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick
and their shields broad.

THEODEN
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.

THEODEN
They will break upon this fortress like
water on rock. Saruman’s hordes will
pillage and burn, we’ve seen it before.
Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt.
Within these walls, we will outlast
them.

ARAGORN
They do not come to destroy Rohan’s
crops or villages. They come to destroy
its people. Down to the last child.

THEODEN
What would
you have me do? Look at my men. Their
courage hangs by a thread. If this is
to be our end, then I would have them
make such an end as to be worthy of
remembrance.

ARAGORN
Send out riders, my lord. You must call
for aid.

THEODEN
And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We
are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.

ARAGORN
Gondor will answer.

THEODEN
Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold
fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies
closed in around us? Where was Gon –
No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone.
Get the women and children into the
caves.

GAMLING
We need more time to lay provisions
for a siege, lord –

THEODEN
There is no time. War is upon us!

ROHAN CAPTAIN
Secure the gate!

STOP

TREEBEARD
We Ents have not troubled about the
wars of men and wizards for a very long
time. But now something is about to
happen that has not happened for an
age: Ent Moot.

MERRY
What’s that?

TREEBEARD
'Tis a gathering.

MERRY
A gathering of what?

TREEBEARD
Beech, oak, chestnut, ash. Good, good,
good. Many have come. Now we must decide
if the Ents will go to war.

STOP

ARAGORN
Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These
are no soldiers.

GIMLI
Most have seen too many winters.

LEGOLAS
Or too few. Look at them. They’re frightened.
I can see it in their eyes. Boe a hûn: neled herain

Three hundred against ten thousand!)

here than at Edoras.)

They cannot win this fight. They are
all going to die!)

ARAGORN
Then I shall die as one them!

GIMLI
Let him go,
lad. Let him be.

STOP

GAMLING
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armory. My lord?

THEODEN
Who am I, Gamling?

GAMLING
You are our king, sire.

THEODEN
And do you trust your king?

GAMLING
Your men, my lord, will
follow you to whatever end.

THEODEN
To whatever end. Where is the horse
and the rider? Where is the horn that
was blowing? They have passed like rain
on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the west.
Behind the hills, into shadow. How did
it come to this?

STOP

ARAGORN
Give me your sword. What is your name?

HALETH
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord. The men
are saying that we will not live out
the night. They say that it is hopeless.

ARAGORN
This is a good sword, Haleth, son of
Hama.

ARAGORN
There is always hope.

STOP

LEGOLAS
We have trusted you this far. You have
not led us astray. Forgive me. I was
wrong to despair.

ARAGORN
Ú-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing
to forgive, Legolas.)

GIMLI
If we had more time I’d get this adjusted.
It’s a little tight across the chest.

LEGOLAS
That is no Orc horn.

BEREG
Send for the king.
Open the gate!

SOLDIER
Open the gate!

STOP

THEODEN
How is this possible?

HALDIR
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves
and men. Long ago we fought and died
together. We come to honor that allegiance.

ARAGORN
Mae govannen, Haldir.
(Welcome, Haldir)

ARAGORN
You are most welcome!

HALDIR
We are proud to
fight alongside men, once more.

STOP

GIMLI
You could have picked a better
spot.

GIMLI
Well lad, whatever luck you live by,
let’s hope it lasts the night.

LEGOLAS
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

GIMLI
Let’s hope they last the night.

ARAGORN
A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn an
uben tanatha le faelas! (Show them no
mercy! For you shall receive none!)

GIMLI
What’s
happening out there?

LEGOLAS
Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like
me to find you a box?

GIMLI
Hehehehe!

ARAGORN
Dartho! (Hold!)

THEODEN
So it begins.

ARAGORN
Tangado halad! (Prepare to fire!)

LEGOLAS
Faeg i-varv dîn na lanc a nu ranc. (Their
armor is weak at the neck and beneath
the arms.)

ARAGORN
Leithio i philinn! (Release the arrows!)

GIMLI
Did they hit anything?

THEODEN
Give them a volley.

GAMLING
Fire!

STOP

GIMLI
Legolas, two already!

LEGOLAS
I’m on seventeen!

GIMLI
Argh! I’ll have no pointy-ear
outscoring me!

LEGOLAS
Nineteen!

STOP

PIPPIN
Merry!

TREEBEARD
We have just agreed.

MERRY
Yes?

TREEBEARD
I have told your names to the Ent moot
and we have agreed – you are not Orcs.

PIPPIN
Well, that’s good news.

MERRY
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about HIM?

TREEBEARD
Now don’t be hasty,
Master Meriadoc.

MERRY
Hasty? Our friends are out there! They
need our help! They cannot fight this
war on their own.

TREEBEARD
War, yes. It affects us all. But you
must understand, young hobbit. It takes
a loong time to say anything in ooold -
Entish. And we never say anything -
unless it is worth taking
a looong time to say.

STOP

GIMLI
Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!
Twenty-one! Twenty-two!

ARAGORN
Na fennas! (Causeway!)

THEODEN
Is this it? Is this all you can conjure,
Saruman?

ARAGORN
Togo hon dad, Legolas! (Bring him down,
Legolas!) Dago hon! Dago hon! (Kill him!
Kill him!)

THEODEN
Brace the Gate! Hold them! Stand firm!

GIMLI
Aragorn! Argh!

ARAGORN
Gimli! Hado i philinn! (Hurl the arrows!)

ARAGORN
Herio! (Charge!)

STOP

TREEBEARD
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have
always done.

MERRY
How can that be your decision?!

TREEBEARD
This is not our war.

MERRY
But you're part of this world! Aren’t
you?! You must help, please! You
must do something!

TREEBEARD
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.

PIPPIN
Maybe Treebeard’s right. We don’t belong
here, Merry. It's too big for us. What
can we do in the end? We've got the
Shire. Maybe we should go home.

MERRY
The fires
of Isengard will spread. And the woods
of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

STOP

GAMLING
Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get
your men out of there!

ARAGORN
Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad!
(To the Keep! Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir, to the Keep!)

GIMLI
What are you doing? Argh!
What are you stopping for!

ARAGORN
HALDIR!

STOP

THEODEN
To the gate! Draw
your swords!

GAMLING
Make way! We cannot hold much longer.

ARAGORN
How long do
you need?

THEODEN
As long as you can give me!

THEODEN
Brace the Gate!

GIMLI
Come on! We can take ‘em!

ARAGORN
It’s a long way.

GIMLI
Toss me.

ARAGORN
What?

GIMLI
I cannot jump the distance! You’ll have
to toss me!

GIMLI
Oh! Don’t tell the Elf.

ARAGORN
Not a word.

STOP

THEODEN
Pull everybody back! Pull them back!

THEODEN
They’ve broken through! The castle is
breached. Retreat!

GAMLING
Fall back!

THEODEN
Retreat!

ARAGORN
Hurry! Inside! Get them inside!

GAMLING
Into the Keep!

STOP

TREEBEARD
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest. You can make your way
north to your homeland from there.

PIPPIN
Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take
us south!

TREEBEARD
South? But that will lead you past Isengard.

PIPPIN
Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can
slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer
we are to danger, the farther we are
from harm. It’s the last thing he’ll
expect.

TREEBEARD
Mmmm. That doesn’t make sense to me.
But then, you are very small. Perhaps
you’re right. South it is then. Hold
on, little Shirelings. I always like
going south. Somehow it feels like going
down hill.

MERRY
Are you mad? We’ll be caught!

PIPPIN
No we won’t. Not this time.

STOP

RANGER 1
Look! Osgiliath burns!

RANGER 2
Mordor has come.

FRODO
The Ring will
not save Gondor. It has only the power
to destroy. Please, let me go.

FARAMIR
Hurry.

FRODO
Faramir, you must let me go!

STOP

TREEBEARD
And a little family of field mice that
climb up sometimes and they tickle me
awfully. They’re always trying to get
somewhere where they – Oh!

TREEBEARD
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.

PIPPIN
I’m sorry, Treebeard.

TREEBEARD
They had voices
of their own.
Saruman! A wizard should know better!

TREEBEARD
There is no curse in Elvish, Entish
or the tongues of men for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight.
With rock and stone!

MERRY
Yes!

TREEBEARD
Hoorarooom. Come my friends. The Ents
are going to war. It is likely that
we go to our doom. Last march of the
Ents!

STOP

MADRIL
Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we’ll be overrun.

SAM
Mr Frodo!

FRODO
It’s calling to him, Sam. His eye is
almost on me.

SAM
Hold on, Mr Frodo. You'll be alright.

FARAMIR
Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir
sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will
change our fortunes in this war.

SAM
Do you want to know what happened to
Boromir? You want to know why your brother
died? He tried to take the Ring from
Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect
him, he tried to kill him! The Ring
drove your brother mad!

RANGER
Watch out!

SAM
Mr Frodo?

FRODO
They’re here. They’ve
come.

FARAMIR
NAZGÛL!
Stay here. Keep out of sight. Take cover!

STOP

THEODEN
The fortress is taken. It is over.

ARAGORN
You said this
fortress would never fall while your
men defend it! They still defend it!
They have died defending it!

ARAGORN
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?

GAMLING
There is one passage. It leads into
the mountains. But they will not get
far. The Uruk-hai are too many.

ARAGORN
Send word for the women and children
to make for the mountain pass. And barricade
the entrance.

THEODEN
So much death. What can men do against
such reckless hate?

ARAGORN
Ride out with me. Ride out and
meet them.

THEODEN
For death and glory.

ARAGORN
For Rohan. For your people.

GIMLI
The sun is rising.

GANDALF (V.O.)
Look to my coming at first light on
the fifth day. At dawn, look to the
east.

THEODEN
Yes. Yes! The horn of Helm Hammerhand
shall sound in the deep one last time!

GIMLI
Yes!

THEODEN
Let this be the hour when we draw swords
together. Fell deeds awake. Now for
wrath! Now for ruin! And a red dawn!

THEODEN
FORTH EORLINGAS!

STOP

ARAGORN
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Theoden king stands alone.

EOMER
Not alone. Rohirrim!

THEODEN
Eomer!

EOMER
To the king!

STOP

THEODEN
Victory! We have victory!

STOP

PIPPIN
Yes!

TREEBEARD
A hit. A fine hit!

TREEBEARD
Break the dam! Release the river!

MERRY
Pippin, hold on!

TREEBEARD
Hold on, little hobbits!

STOP

SAM
What are you doing? Where are you going?!

FRODO
Aaarrgghh!

SAM
It’s me. It’s your Sam.
Don’t you know your Sam?

FRODO
I can’t do
this, Sam.

SAM
I know. It’s all wrong. By rights we
shouldn’t even be here. But we are.
It’s like in the great stories, Mr Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn’t want to know the end.
Because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it
was when so much bad had happened?

SAM
But in the end, it’s only a passing
thing, this shadow. Even darkness
must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines
it will shine out the clearer. Those
were the stories that stayed with you.
That meant something, even if you were
too small to understand why. But I think,
Mr Frodo, I do understand. I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances
of turning back only they didn’t. They
kept going because they were holding
on to something.

FRODO
What are we holding on to, Sam?

SAM
There’s some good in this world, Mr
Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for.

FARAMIR
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

MADRIL
You know the laws of our country, the
laws of your father. If you let them
go, your life will be forfeit.

FARAMIR
Then it is forfeit. Release them.

STOP

GANDALF
Sauron’s wrath will be terrible, his
retribution swift. The battle for Helm’s
Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin. All our hopes now
lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere
in the wilderness.

STOP

SAM
I wonder if we’ll ever be put into songs
or tales.

FRODO
What?

SAM
I wonder if people will ever say, ‘let’s
hear about Frodo and the Ring.’ And
they’ll say ‘yes, that’s one of my favorite
stories. Frodo was really courageous,
wasn’t he, dad.’ ‘Yes, my boy, the most
famousest of hobbits. And that’s saying
alot.’

FRODO
Huh, you left out one of the chief characters
– Samwise the Brave. I want to hear
more about Sam.

FRODO
Frodo wouldn’t have got far without
Sam.

SAM
Now Mr Frodo, you shouldn’t make fun.
I was being serious.

FRODO
So was I.

SAM
Samwise the Brave.

FRODO
Smeagol!

SAM
We’re not gonna wait for you. Come on!

SMEAGOL
Master - Master looks after us. Master
wouldn’t hurt us.

GOLLUM
Master broke his promise.

SMEAGOL
Don’t ask Smeagol. Poor, poor Smeagol.

GOLLUM
Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy,
false. We ought to wring his filthy
little neck. Kill him! Kill him! Kill them
both. And then we take the precious
and we be the master.

SMEAGOL
The
fat hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.

GOLLUM
Then we stabs them out. Put out his
eyeses. And make HIM crawl.

SMEAGOL
Yes! Yes! Yes!

GOLLUM
Kill them both.

SMEAGOL
Yes! No no!
It’s too risky, it’s too risky.

SAM
Where’s he gone? Hey Gollum, where are
you?

FRODO
Smeagol?

GOLLUM
We could let
HER do it.

SMEAGOL
Yes. She could do it.

GOLLUM
Yes, precious she could. And then we
takes it once they’re dead.

SMEAGOL
Once they’re dead-

GOLLUM
Shh!

SMEAGOL
Come on, hobbits. Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.

GOLLUM
Follow me.
