GALADRIEL
The world is changed: I feel it in the
water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it
in the air. Much that once was is lost,
for none now live who remember it.

GALADRIEL
It began with the forging of the Great
Rings.

GALADRIEL
Three were given to the Elves, immortal,
wisest and fairest of all beings.

GALADRIEL
Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great miners
and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

GALADRIEL
And Nine, nine rings were gifted to the
race of Men who, above all else, desire
power.

GALADRIEL
For within these rings was bound the
strength and will to govern each race.

GALADRIEL
But they were all of them deceived.

GALADRIEL
for another ring was made.

GALADRIEL
In the land of Mordor, in the fires of
Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring to control all
others.

GALADRIEL
and into this Ring he poured his
cruelty, his malice and his will to
dominate all life.

GALADRIEL
One Ring to rule them all.

GALADRIEL
One by one the Free lands of Middle earth
fell to the power of the ring.

GALADRIEL
But there were some who resisted.

GALADRIEL
A last alliance of Men and Elves marched
against the armies of Mordor.

GALADRIEL
On the slopes of Mount Doom they fought
for the freedom of Middle-Earth.

GALADRIEL
Victory was near!

GALADRIEL
But the power of the Ring could not be
undone.

GALADRIEL
It was in this moment, when all hope had
faded, that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

GALADRIEL
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of
Middle Earth, was defeated.

GALADRIEL
The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this
one chance to destroy evil forever.

GALADRIEL
But the hearts of Men are easily
corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a
will of its own.

GALADRIEL
It betrayed Isildur to his death.

GALADRIEL
And some things that should not have been
forgotten, were lost.

GALADRIEL
History became legend, legend became
myth.

GALADRIEL
And for two and a half thousand years the
Ring passed out of all knowledge.

GALADRIEL
Until, when chance came, it ensnared a
new bearer!

GOLLUM
My Precious.

GALADRIEL
The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who
took it deep into the tunnels of the
Misty Mountains.

GALADRIEL
And there, it consumed him.

GOLLUM
It came to me. My own. My love,
my preciousness.

GALADRIEL
The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long
life. For five hundred years it poisoned
his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's
cave, it waited.

GALADRIEL
Darkness crept back into the forests of
the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the
East. Whispers of a nameless fear. And
the Ring of Power perceived its time
had now come. It abandoned Gollum.

GALADRIEL
But something happened then the Ring did
not intend.

GALADRIEL
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

BILBO
What's this?

GALADRIEL
A Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

BILBO
A Ring!

GOLLUM
Lost! Lost! My Precious is lost!

GALADRIEL
For the time will soon come when Hobbits
will shape the fortunes of all.

STOP

FRODO
You're late.

GANDALF
A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,
nor is he early. He arrives precisely
when he means to.

FRODO
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

GANDALF
You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle
Bilbo's birthday?

FRODO
What news of the outside world? Tell me
everything!

GANDALF
What, everything? Far too eager and
curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural.

GANDALF
Well, what can I tell you? Life in the
wide world goes on much as if it has past
age. Full of its own comings and goings,
scarcely even aware of the existence of
Hobbits, for which I am very thankful.

STOP

GANDALF
Ah, the long expected party. So, how is
the old rascal? I hear it's going to be
a Party of Special Magnificence.

FRODO
You know Bilbo. He's got the whole place
in an uproar.

GANDALF
Oh, well. That should please him.

FRODO
Half the Shire's been invited.

GANDALF
Good gracious, me.

FRODO
He's up to something.

GANDALF
Oh, really?

FRODO
Alright then. Keep your secrets. Before
you came along we Bagginses were very
well thought of.

GANDALF
Indeed?

FRODO
Never had any adventures or did anything
unexpected.

GANDALF
If you're referring to the incident with
the Dragon, i was barely involved. All
I did was give your Uncle a little nudge
out the door.

FRODO
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.

GANDALF
Oh, really?

STOP

FRODO
Gandalf, I'm glad you're back.

GANDALF
So am I, dear boy. So am I.

STOP

BILBO
No, thank you! We don't want any more
visitors, well wishers, or distant
relations!

GANDALF
And what about very old friends?

BILBO
Gandalf?

GANDALF
Bilbo Baggins!

BILBO
My dear Gandalf!

GANDALF
It's good to see you. One hundred and
eleven years old, who would believe it!
You haven't aged a day!

BILBO
Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome!

STOP

BILBO
Tea? Or maybe something stronger? I've
a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,
1296. A very good year, almost as old as
I am. It was laid down by my father. What
say we open one, eh?

BILBO
I was expecting you some time last week.
Not that it matters, you come and go as
you please, always have done, always
will.

BILBO
You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm
afraid. We've only got cold chicken, bit
of pickle, some cheese here, ooh, no,
that might be a little risky.

BILBO
Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
tart. Got some custard somewhere. Not
much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh
no, we're alright! I've just found some
sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope
it's enough. I could do you some eggs
if you like?

GANDALF
Just tea, thank you.

BILBO
Oh, right. You don't mind if?

GANDALF
No, not at all. Go ahead.

STOP

MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS
Bilbo Baggins, you open this door! I know you're in there.

BILBO
I'm not home.

BILBO
I've got to get away from these
confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
all day, never giving me a moment's
peace. I want to see mountains
again. Mountains, Gandalf! And then
find somewhere quiet where I can finish
my book. Oh, Tea!

GANDALF
So, you mean to go through with your
plan, then?

BILBO
Yes, yes, it's all inhand. All the
arrangements are made.

GANDALF
Frodo suspects something.

BILBO
'Course he does, he's a Baggins! Not
some block headed Bracegirdle from
Hardbottle!

GANDALF
You will tell him, won't you?

BILBO
Yes, yes.

GANDALF
He's very fond of you.

BILBO
I know. He'd probably come with me if I
asked him. I think, in his heart,
Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the
woods and the fields, little rivers.

BILBO
I am old, Gandalf.

BILBO
I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning
to feel it in my heart.

BILBO
I feel thin, sort of stretched, like
butter scraped over too much bread. I
need a holiday. A very long holiday and
I don't expect I shall return. In fact,
I mean not to.

STOP

BILBO
Old Toby, the finest weed in
Southfarthing!

BILBO
Ohhhh, Gandalf my old friend, this will be a
night to remember!

STOP

FRODO
Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.

SAM
I think I'll just have myself another
ale.

FRODO
Oh, no you don't. Go on.

STOP

BILBO
So, there I was, at the mercy of three
monstrous trolls. Have you ever heard of
a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?
Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly
things. And they're arguing, arguing
about how they were going to cook us!

BILBO
Whether it be turned on a spit or minced
in a pie or whether they were going to
sit on us one by one and squash us into
jelly! But they spent so long arguing
the whether-to's and why-for's that the
sun's first light crept over the top of
the trees. And turned them all to stone!

STOP

MERRY
No, no, the big one! The big one!

MERRY
You're supposed to stick it in the
ground!

PIPPIN
It is in the ground.

MERRY
Outside!

PIPPIN
It was your idea.

STOP

FRODO
Bilbo! Watch out for the dragon!

BILBO
Dragon? Nonsense! Hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years!

STOP

MERRY
That was good!

PIPPIN
Let's get another one!

GANDALF
Meridoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.
I might have known!

STOP

FRODO
Speech!

BILBO
My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and
Brandybucks, Grubbs, Chubbs,
Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and
Proudfoots.

ODO PROUDFOOT
Proudfeet!

BILBO
Today is my one hundred and eleventh
birthday. Yes, and alas, eleventy- one
years is far too short a time to live
among such excellent and admirable
Hobbits!

BILBO
I don't know half of you half as well as
I should like; and I like less than half
of you as well as well as you deserve.

BILBO
I have things to do and I have put this
off for far too long.

BILBO
I regret to announce, this is the end. I
am going now. I bid you all a very fond
farewell!

BILBO
Goodbye.

STOP

GANDALF
I suppose you think that was terribly
clever?

BILBO
Come on, Gandalf! Did you see their
faces?

GANDALF
There are many magic rings in the world,
Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be
used lightly.

BILBO
It was just a bit of fun. Oh, you're
probably right as usual.

GANDALF
You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

BILBO
I'm leaving everything to him.

GANDALF
What about this ring of yours? Is that
staying too?

BILBO
Yes, yes, it's in an envelope, over
there on the mantelpiece.

BILBO
No, wait. It's here in my pocket.
Isn't that odd now? Yet, after
all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?

GANDALF
I think you should leave the Ring behind,
Bilbo. Is that so hard?

BILBO
Well, no, and yes. Now that it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it. It's
mine. I found it. It came to me!

GANDALF
There's no need to get angry.

BILBO
Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's
mine. My own, my precious.

GANDALF
Precious? It's been called that before,
but not by you.

BILBO
So? What business is it of yours what I
do with my own things?

GANDALF
I think you've had that ring quite long
enough.

BILBO
You want it for yourself!

GANDALF
Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some
conjurer of cheap tricks!

GANDALF
I am not trying to rob you. I am trying
to help you.

GANDALF
All you long years we've been
friends. Trust me as you once did. Let
it go!

BILBO
You're right, Gandalf, the ring must go
to Frodo.

BILBO
It's late, the road is long. Yes, it is
time.

GANDALF
Bilbo?

BILBO
Hmmm?

GANDALF
The ring is still in your pocket.

BILBO
Oh, yes.

STOP

BILBO
I've thought up and ending for my
book: "And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

GANDALF
I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

BILBO
Goodbye, Gandalf.

GANDALF
Goodbye Bilbo.

GANDALF
Until our next meeting.

STOP

BILBO
It's mine, my own, my precious.

GANDALF
Riddles in the dark.

FRODO
Bilbo! Bilbo!

FRODO
He's gone, hasn't he? Frodo steps into
the living room.

FRODO
He talked for so long about leaving.
I didn't think he'd really do it.

FRODO
Gandalf?

GANDALF
Bilbo's ring.

GANDALF
He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's
left you Bag End, along with all his possessions.

GANDALF
The ring is yours now. Put it somewhere
out of sight.

FRODO
Where are you going?

GANDALF
I have some things I must see to.

FRODO
What things?

GANDALF
Questions. Questions that need
answering.

FRODO
You've only just arrived!I don't
understand!

GANDALF
Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it
safe.

STOP

BLACK RIDER
Shire? Baggins?

FARMER MAGGOT
There's no Bagginses around here! They
are all up in Hobbiton, that way.

STOP

GANDALF
Is it secret? Is it safe?

FRODO
What are you doing?

GANDALF
Hold out your hand, Frodo. It is quite
cool.

GANDALF
What can you see? Can you see anything?

FRODO
Nothing, there's nothing. Wait.
There are markings.

FRODO
It's some form of Elvish, I can't read
it.

GANDALF
There are few who can. The language is
that of Mordor, which I will not utter
here.

GANDALF
In the common tongue it says, "One ring to rule them all, One
ring to find them, One ring to bring them all, and in the
darkness bind them."

GANDALF
This is the one ring forged by the dark
lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mount
Doom. Taken by Isildur from the hand of
Sauron himself.

FRODO
Bilbo found it in Gollom's cave.

GANDALF
For sixty years the ring lay quiet in
Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life,
delaying old age, but no longer Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has
awoken. It has heard its master's call.

FRODO
But he was destroyed. Sauron was
destroyed.

GANDALF
No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has
endured. His life force is bound to the
ring and the ring survived. Sauron has
returned. His Orcs have multiplied. His
fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the
land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this
ring to cover all the lands in the second
darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it,
all his thought is bent on it. For the
ring yearns, above all else, to return to
the hand of its master: they are one, the
ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must
never find out.

FRODO
Alright!

FRODO
We put it away, we keep it hidden! We
never speak of it again. No one know
it's here, do they? Gandalf shifts
uncomfortably.

FRODO
Do they, Gandalf?

GANDALF
There is one other who knew that Bilbo
had the Ring. I looked everywhere for
the creature Gollum, but the enemy found
him first.

GANDALF
I don't know how long they tortured
him, but amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words.

GOLLUM
Shire! Baggins!

FRODO
Shire! Baggins! That will lead them
here!

FRODO
Take it! Take it!

GANDALF
No, Frodo.

FRODO
You must take it.

GANDALF
You cannot offer me this ring.

FRODO
I'm giving it to you!

GANDALF
Don't tempt me, Frodo. I dare not take
it, not even to keep it safe.

GANDALF
Understand, Frodo! I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good. But through
me, it would wield a power too great and
terrible to imagine.

FRODO
But it cannot stay in the Shire!

GANDALF
No, no it can't.

FRODO
What must I do?

GANDALF
You must leave, and leave quickly. Get
out of the Shire.

FRODO
Where? Where shall I go?

GANDALF
Make for the village of Bree.

FRODO
Bree? What about you?

GANDALF
I will be waiting for you at the Inn of
the Prancing Pony.

FRODO
And the ring will be safe there?

GANDALF
I don't know, Frodo. I don't have any
answers. I must see the Head of my
Order. He is both wise and powerful.
Trust me, Frodo. He'll know what to go.

GANDALF
You'll have to leave the name of Baggins
behind you, for that name is not safe
outside the Shire.

GANDALF
Travel only by day and stay off the road.

FRODO
I can cut across country easily enough.

GANDALF
My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing
creatures. You can learn all that there
is to know about their ways in a month,
and yet, after a hundred years, they can
still surprise you.

GANDALF
Get down!

GANDALF
Confound it all! Samwise Gamgee, have
you been eavesdropping?

SAM
I ain't been dropping no eaves, sir!
Honest. I was just cutting the grass
under the window there, if you follow
me.

GANDALF
It's a little late for trimming the
hedges, don't you think?

SAM
I heard raised voices!

GANDALF
What did you hear? Speak!

SAM
Nothing important. That is, I heard a
good deal about a ring and a Dark Lord.
And something about the end of the world.
But please, Mister Gandalf, sir, don't
hurt me! Don't turn me into anything
unnatural!

GANDALF
No?

GANDALF
Perhaps not. I've thought of a better
use for you.

STOP

GANDALF
Come along, Samwise, keep up!

GANDALF
Be careful, both of you. The Enemy has
many spies in his service, many ways of
hearing: Birds and beasts.

GANDALF
Is it safe?

GANDALF
Never put it on, for then the agents of
the Dark Lord will be drawn to its
power. Always remember, Frodo, the ring
is trying to get back to its master. It
wants to be found.

STOP

SAM
This is it.

FRODO
This is what?

SAM
If I take one more step it'll be the
farthest away from home I've ever been.

FRODO
Come on, Sam.

FRODO
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

BILBO
It's a dangerous business, Frodo,
going out your door. You step onto the
road, and if you don't keep your feet,
there's not knowing where you might be
swept off to.

STOP

SARUMAN
Smoke rises once more from the mountain
of doom. The shadow takes shape in the
darkness of Mordor. The hour grows
late, and Gandalf the Grey rides to
Isengard seeking my counsel.

SARUMAN
For that is why you have come, is it not,
my old friend?

GANDALF
Saruman!

SARUMAN
Are you sure of this?

GANDALF
Beyond any doubt.

SARUMAN
So the ring of power has been found?

GANDALF
All these long years it was in the Shire,
under my very nose.

SARUMAN
And yet you did not have the wit to see
it! Your love of the Halfling's leaf has
clearly slowed your mind.

GANDALF
We still have time, time enough to
counter Sauron if we act quickly.

SARUMAN
Time? What time do you think we have?

SARUMAN
Sauron has regained much of his former
strength. He cannot yet take physical
form, but his spirit has lost none of
its potency. Concealed within his
fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all.
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth,
and flesh. You know of what I speak,
Gandalf. A great Eye, lidless, wreathed
in flame.

GANDALF
The eye of Sauron.

SARUMAN
He is gathering all evil to him.

SARUMAN
Very soon he will have summoned an army
great enough to launch an assault upon
Middle earth.

GANDALF
You know this? How?

SARUMAN
I have seen it.

GANDALF
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

SARUMAN
Why? Why should we fear to use it?

GANDALF
They are not all accounted for, the lost
seeing-stones. We do not know who else
may be watching.

SARUMAN
The hour is later than you think.
Sauron's forces are already moving. The
Nine have left Minas Morgul.

GANDALF
The nine!

SARUMAN
They crossed the river Isen in
Midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in
black.

GANDALF
They have reached the Shire?

SARUMAN
They will find the ring, and kill the
one who carries it.

SARUMAN
You did not seriously think a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?
There are none who can.

SARUMAN
Against the power of Mordor, there can be
no victory. We must join with him,
Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It
would be wise, my friend.

GANDALF
Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the
wise abandon reason for madness?

SARUMAN
I gave you the chance of aiding me
willingly, but you have elected the way
of pain.

STOP

SAM
Mister Frodo. Mister Frodo!

SAM
I thought I lost you.

FRODO
What are you talking about?

SAM
It's just something Gandalf said.

FRODO
What did he say?

SAM
He said: "Don't you leave him, Samwise
Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

FRODO
Sam, we're still in the Shire. What
could possibly happen?

PIPPIN
Frodo! Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.

MERRY
Hello Frodo!

SAM
What's the meaning of this!

MERRY
Sam, hold this.

SAM
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

FARMER MAGGOT
Who's that in my field! Get out of it!
Get out of my field, you young varmits!
I'll show you! Get out of my corn!

MERRY
I don't know why he's so upset, it's only
a couple of carrots.

PIPPIN
And some cabbages! And those three bags
of potatoes that we lifted last week.
And then the mushrooms the week before.

MERRY
Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly
over reacting.

PIPPIN
Run!

STOP

PIPPIN
That was close.

MERRY
Ow! I think I've broken something.

SAM
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.

MERRY
What? That was just a detour.
A shortcut!

SAM
A shortcut to what?

PIPPIN
Mushrooms!

FRODO
I think we should get off the road.

FRODO
Get off the road!

STOP

MERRY
What was that?

SAM
Anything?

FRODO
Nothing.

PIPPIN
What is going on?

MERRY
The Black rider was looking for
something. Or someone. Frodo?

SAM
Get down!

FRODO
I have to leave the Shire. Sam and I
must get to Bree.

MERRY
Right. Buckleberry Ferry. Follow me !

MERRY
There's another one! Frodo, this way!

MERRY
Frodo, follow me!

MERRY
Get the ropes, Sam.

SAM
Frodo!

FRODO
How far to the nearest crossing?

MERRY
The brandwine bridge. Twenty miles.

STOP

FRODO
Come on.

GATEKEEPER
What do you want?

FRODO
We're headed for the prancing pony.

GATEKEEPER
Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what's more,
out of the Shire by your talk. What
business brings you to Bree?

FRODO
We wish to stay at the inn. Our business
is our own.

GATEKEEPER
All right, young sir, I meant no offense.

GATEKEEPER
It's my job to ask questions after
nightfall. There's talk of strange fold
abroad. Can't be too careful.

STOP

FRODO
Excuse me.

BUTTERBUR
Good evening, little masters. If you're
seeking accommodation, we've got some
nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms available,
Mister?

FRODO
Underhill. My name's Underbill.

BUTTERBUR
Underhill? Hmmmm.

FRODO
We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can
you tell him we've arrived?

BUTTERBUR
Gandalf, Gandalf. Oh.
Oh yes! I remember! Elderly chap, big
grey beard, pointy hat?

BUTTERBUR
Not seen him for six months.

SAM
What do we do now?

FRODO
Sam, he'll be here. He'll come.

PIPPIN
What's that?

MERRY
This, my friend, is a pint.

PIPPIN
It comes in pints? I'm getting one!

SAM
You've had a whole half already.

SAM
That fellow's done nothing but stare at
you since we've arrived.

FRODO
Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is
he?

BUTTERBUR
He's one of them Rangers; they're
dangerous folk they are, wandering the
wilds. What his right name is, I never
heard, but round here he's known as
Strider.

STOP

PIPPIN
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins! He's
over there!

PIPPIN
Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin
once removed, on his mother's side and my
third cousin twice removed on his
father's side, if you follow me.

STOP

STRIDER
You draw far too much attention to
yourself, Mister Underhill.

FRODO
What do you want?

STRIDER
A little more caution from you, that is
no trinket you carry.

FRODO
I carry nothing.

STRIDER
Indeed? I can usually avoid being seen
if I wish, but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

FRODO
Who are you?

STRIDER
Are you frightened?

FRODO
Yes.

STRIDER
Not nearly frightened enough. I know
what hunts you.

SAM
Let him go or I'll have you, Longshanks!

STRIDER
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit,
but that alone won't save you. You can
no longer wait for the Wizard, Frodo.
They're coming.

STOP

FRODO
Who are they?

STRIDER
They were once men.

STRIDER
Great Kings of men. Then Sauron the
deceiver gave to them Nine Rings of
Power. Blinded by their greed they took
them without question, one by one falling
into darkness and now they are slaves to
his will.

STRIDER
They are the Nazgul, Ringwraiths, neither
living or dead. At all times they feel
the presence of the ring, drawn to the
power of the one. They will never stop
hunting you.

STOP

FRODO
Where are you taking us?

STRIDER
Into the wild.

MERRY
How do, we know this Strider is a friend
of Gandalf?

FRODO
We have no choice but to trust him.

STRIDER
But where is he leading us?

STRIDER
To Rivendell, Master Gamgee. To the
house of Elrond.

SAM
Did you hear that, Bill? Rivendell!
We're going to see the Elves!

STOP

STRIDER
Gentlemen, we do not stop until
nightfall.

PIPPIN
What about breakfast?

STRIDER
You've already had it.

PIPPIN
We've had one, yes! But what about
Second Breakfast?

MERRY
I don't think he knows about second
breakfast, Pip.

PIPPIN
What about Elvenses, Luncheon, Afternoon
Tea, dinner? He knows about them,
doesn't he?

MERRY
I wouldn't count on it.

STOP

SARUMAN
The power of Isengard is at your command,
Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

SAURONS VOICE
Build me an army worth of Mordor.

ORC OVERSEER
What orders from Mordor, my Lord. What
does the eye command?

SARUMAN
We have work to do.

STOP

ORC OVERSEER
The trees are strong, my Lord. Their
roots go deep.

SARUMAN
Rip them all down.

STOP

STRIDER
This was once the great Watchtower of
Amon Sul. We shall rest here tonight.

STRIDER
There are for you. Keep them close. I'm
going to have a look around. Stay here.

STOP

FRODO
What are you doing?

MERRY
Tomatoes, sausages, and crispy bacon.

SAM
We saved some for you, Mister Frodo.

FRODO
Put it out, you fools! Put it out!

PIPPIN
Oh, that's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

FRODO
Go!

STOP

SAM
Mister Frodo!
Help him, Strider!

STRIDER
He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

SAM
Do something.

STRIDER
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

STRIDER
Hurry!

SAM
We are six days from Rivendell.

STRIDER
Hold on, Frodo.

SAM
He'll never make it!

FRODO
Gandalf? Gandalf?

STOP

PIPPIN
Is he going to die?

STRIDER
No. He is passing into the shadow world,
he will soon become a wraith like them.

MERRY
They're close.

STRIDER
Sam, do you know the Athelas plant? Sam
looks blank.

SAM
Athelas?

STRIDER
Kingsfoil.

SAM
Kingsfoil. Aye. It's a weed.

STRIDER
It may help to slow the poison. Hurry!

ARWEN
What is this? A Ranger caught off his
guard?

STOP

ARWEN
Frodo, Im Arwen. Telin let thaed. I am
Arwen, I have come here to help you.
Hear my voice, come back to the light.

PIPPIN
Who is she?

ARWEN
Frodo?

SAM
She's an elf.

ARWEN
He's fading, he's not going to last. We
must get him to my father.

ARWEN
I have been looking for you for two days.

PIPPIN
Where are you taking him?

ARWEN
There are five Wraiths behind you, where
the other four are, I do not know.

STRIDER
Stay with the hobbits. I'll
send horses for you.

ARWEN
I'm the faster rider.

STRIDER
The road is too dangerous.

ARWEN
If I can cross the river, the
power of my people can protect him.

PIPPIN
What are they saying?

ARWEN
I do not fear them.

STRIDER
Arwen: ride hard, don't look back.

ARWEN
Noro Lim, Asfaloth, Noro Lim!

SAM
What are you doing! Those Wraiths are
still out there!

STOP

WITCH KING
Give up the Halfling, she-elf!

ARWEN
If you want him, come and claim him.

ARWEN
Non o Chithaeglir, lasto Beth daer: Rimmo
nin Briunen Dan in Ulaer!

STOP

ARWEN
No, no Frodo, no! Frodo, don't give
in! Not now!

ARWEN
What grace is given me, let it pass to
him. Let him be spared. Save him.

STOP

FRODO
Where am I?

GANDALF
You are in the House of Elrond, and it is
ten o'clock in the morning on October the
twenty-fourth, if you want to know.

FRODO
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be
here, too. A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid. You have
some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.

FRODO
What happened, Gandalf? Why didn't you
meet us?

GANDALF
I'm sorry Frodo.

GANDALF
I was delayed.

STOP

SARUMAN
Get up! Embrace the power of the
Ring or embrace your own destruction!

GANDALF
There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only
one who can bend it to his will, and he
does not share power.

SARUMAN
So you have chosen death.

STOP

FRODO
Gandalf! What is it?

GANDALF
Nothing, Frodo.

SAM
Frodo! Frodo! Bless you, you're awake!

GANDALF
Sam has hardly left your side.

SAM
We were worried about you--weren't we,
Mister Gandalf?

GANDALF
By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're
beginning to mend.

ELROND
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

ELROND
You have found your way to the last
homely house east of the sea. The elves
of Imladris have dwelt within this valley
for three thousand years, though few of
my kin now remain.

STOP

FRODO
"There and back again: A Hobbit's tale"
by Bilbo Baggins.

FRODO
This is wonderful!

BILBO
I meant to go back, wander the paths of
Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely
Mountain again. But age, it seems, has
finally caught up with me.

FRODO
I miss the Shire. I spent all my
childhood pretending I was off somewhere
else. Off with you, on one of your
adventures.
But my own adventure, turned out to be
quite different. I'm not like you,
Bilbo.

BILBO
My dear boy.

STOP

SAM
No, what have I forgotten?

FRODO
Packed already?

SAM
No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls
to the edge of the Balcony.

FRODO
I thought you wanted to see the Elves,
Sam?

SAM
I do.

FRODO
More than anything.

SAM
I did. It's just - we did what Gandalf
wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this
far, to Rivendell, and I thought:
Seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be
off soon. Off home.

FRODO
You're right, Sam.

FRODO
We did what we set out to do.

FRODO
The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am
ready to go home.

STOP

ELROND
His strength returns.

GANDALF
That wound will never fully heal. He will
carry it the rest of his life.

ELROND
And yet to have come so far still bearing
the Ring. The hobbit has shown
extraordinary resilience to its evil.

GANDALF
It is a burden he should never have to
had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.

ELROND
Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's
forces are massing in the east. His eye
is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you
tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of
allies grows thin.

GANDALF
His treachery runs deeper than you know.
By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc
with Goblin Men. He is breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard. An army that
can move in Sunlight and cover great
distance at speed. Saruman is coming for
the Ring.

ELROND
This evil cannot be concealed by the
power of the Elves. We do not have the
strength to fight both Mordor and
Isengard. Gandalf, the ring cannot stay
here.

ELROND
This peril belongs to all Middle earth.
They must decide how to end it. Not just
for themselves but for those who come
after. Elrond approaches Gandalf.

ELROND
The time of the Elves is over. My people
are leaving these shores. Who will you
look to when we have gone? The dwarves?
They hide in their mountains seeking
riches. They care nothing for the
troubles of others.

GANDALF
It is in Men that we must place our hope.

ELROND
Men? Men are weak. The race of Men is
failing. The blood of Numenor is all but
spent, its pride anddignity forgotten.
It is because of menthe Ring survives.

ELROND
I was there, Gandalf. I was there three
thousand years ago when Isildur took the
ring.

ELROND
I was there the day the strength of Men
failed.

STOP

ELROND
Isildur, hurry! Follow me!

ELROND
I let Isildur into the heart of Mount
Doom, where the ring was forged: the one
place it could be destroyed.

ELROND
Cast it into the fire! Destroy it!

ISILDUR
No.

ELROND
Isildur!

STOP

ELROND
It should have ended that day, but evil
was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the
Ring, and the line of Kings was broken.
There's no strength left in the world of
Men. They're scattered, divided,
leaderless.

GANDALF
There is one who could unite them, one
who could re claim the thrown of Gondor.

ELROND
He turned from that path a long time ago.
He has chosen exile.

STOP

BOROMIR
The shards of Narsil! The blade that cut
the Ring from Sauron's hand.

BOROMIR
Still sharp.

BOROMIR
But no more than a broken heirloom.

STOP

ARWEN
Why do you fear the past? You are
Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself. You
are not bound to his fate.

STRIDER
The same blood flows in my veins. The
same weakness.

ARWEN
Your time will come. You will face the
same evil and you will defeat it.
The shadow does not hold
sway yet. Not over you and not over me.

STOP

ARWEN
Do you remember when we first met?

STRIDER
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

ARWEN
Long years have passed. You
did not have the care you carry now.

ARWEN
Do you remember what I told you?

STRIDER
You said you'd bind yourself to me,
forsaking the immortal life of your
people.

ARWEN
And to that I hold. I would rather share
one lifetime with you than face all the
ages of this world alone.

ARWEN
I choose a mortal live.

STRIDER
You cannot give me this.

ARWEN
It is mine to give to whom I will, like
my heart.

STOP

ELROND
Strangers from distant lands, friends
of old. You have been summoned here to
answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth
stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it. You will unite, or
you will fall. Each race is bound to this
fate, this one doom.

ELROND
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

BOROMIR
So it is true!

LEGOLAS
Sauron's Ring! The ring of power!

GIMLI
The doom of man!

BOROMIR
It is a gift. A gift to the foes of
Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has
my father, the Steward of Gondor, held
the forces of Mordor at bay. By the
blood of our people are your lands kept
safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the
enemy! Let us use it against him!

STRIDER
You cannot wield it. None of us can.
The one ring answers to Sauron alone, it
has no other master.

BOROMIR
And what would a ranger know of this
matter?

LEGOLAS
This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn,
son of Arathorn. You owe him your
allegiance.

BOROMIR
Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?

LEGOLAS
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

ARAGORN
Legolas! Sit down, Legolas.

BOROMIR
Gondor needs no king.

GANDALF
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

ELROND
You have only one choice. The ring must
be destroyed.

GIMLI
Then what are we waiting for?

ELROND
The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son
of Gloin, by any craft that we here possess.
The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom,
only there can it be unmade. It must be
taken deep into Mordor, and cast back into
the fiery chasm from whence it came.
One of you must do this.

BOROMIR
One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its
black gates are guarded by more than just
Orcs. There is evil there that does not
sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful.
It is a barren wasteland, riddled with
fire and ash and dust. The very air you
breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with
ten thousand men could you do this. It
is folly.

LEGOLAS
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has
said? The ring must be destroyed.

GIMLI
And I suppose you think you're the one to
do it?

BOROMIR
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

GIMLI
I will be dead before I see the Ring in
the hands of an Elf!

GIMLI
Never trust an Elf!

GANDALF
Do you not understand? While we bicker
among ourselves, Sauron's power grows!
No one will escape it. You will all be
destroyed, your homes burnt and your
families put to the sword!

FRODO
I will take it. I will take it! I will
take the Ring to Mordor.

FRODO
Though I do not know the way.

GANDALF
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo
Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.

ARAGORN
If, by my life or death I can protect
you, I will.

ARAGORN
you have my sword.

LEGOLAS
And you have my bow.

GIMLI
And my axe!

BOROMIR
You carry the fate of us all, little one.

BOROMIR
If this is indeed the will of the
Council, then Gondor will see it done.

SAM
Here!
Mister Frodo's not going anywhere without me.

ELROND
No, Indeed. It is hardly possible to
separate you, even when he is summoned
to a secret council and you are not.

MERRY
Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to
send us home tied up in a sack to stop
us.

PIPPIN
Anyway, you need people of intelligence
on this sort of - mission. Quest. Thing.

MERRY
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

ELROND
Nine companions. So be it.
You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.

PIPPIN
Great. Where are we going?

STOP

BILBO
My old sword "Sting". Here, take it!

FRODO
It's so light!

BILBO
Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.
The blade glows blue when Orcs are
close. And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

BILBO
Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light
as a feather, and as hard as dragon
scales. Let me see you put it on. Come
on.

BILBO
Oh! My old Ring!

BILBO
I should very much like to hold it again,
one last time.

BILBO
AARRRGH!

BILBO
I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you,
my boy, I'm sorry that you must carry
this burden. I'm sorry for everything.

STOP

BOROMIR
Get away from the blade, Pippin! On your
toes - good, very good. I want you to
react, not think.

SAM
Should not be too hard.

BOROMIR
Move your feet.

MERRY
Quite good, Pippin.

PIPPIN
Thanks.

GIMLI
If anyone were to ask for my opinion,
which I note they have not, I would say
we are taking the long way round.
Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of
Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a
royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks
that is a bad idea.

GANDALF
No, Gimli. I would not take the road
through Moria unless I had no other
choice.

SAM
What is that?

GIMLI
Nothing, it's just a wisp of a cloud.

BOROMIR
It's moving fast. Against the wind.

LEGOLAS
Crebain from Dunland!

ARAGORN
Hide!

BOROMIR
Merry, Pippin, Sam! Take cover!

GANDALF
Spies of Saruman. The passage South is
being watched.

GANDALF
We must take the pass of Caradhras!

STOP

ARAGORN
Boromir?

BOROMIR
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt over so
small a thing. Such a little thing.

ARAGORN
Boromir! Give the ring to Frodo.

BOROMIR
As you wish. I care not.

STOP

SARUMAN
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over
Caradhras. And if that fails, where
then will you go?
If the mountain defeats you, will you
risk a more dangerous road?

LEGOLAS
There is a fell voice in the air.

GANDALF
It's Saruman.

ARAGORN
He's trying to bring down the mountain.
Gandalf! We must turn back!

GANDALF
No!

GANDALF
Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie
still, hold your wrath.

BOROMIR
We must get off the mountain! Make for
the gap of Rohan and take the West road
to my city.

ARAGORN
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to
Isengard.

GIMLI
We cannot pass over the mountain. Let us
go under it. Let us go through the mines
of Moria.

SARUMAN
Moria. You fear to go into those mines,
don't you? The dwarves delved too
greedily and too deep.

SARUMAN
You know what they awoke in, the darkness
of Khazad-dum. Shadow and flame.

GANDALF
Let the ringbearer decide.

GANDALF
Frodo?

FRODO
We will go through the mines.

GANDALF
So be it.

STOP

GIMLI
The walls of Moria!

GANDALF
Ithildin. It mirrors only starlight and
moonlight.

GANDALF
It reads, "The door of Durin, Lord of
Moria. Speak, friend, and enter."

MERRY
What do you suppose that means?

GANDALF
It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
speak the password and the doors will
open.

GANDALF
Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!

ARAGORN
Mines are no place for a Pony, even one
so brave as Bill.

SAM
Bye, Bill.

ARAGORN
Go on, Bill, go on. Don't worry, Sam. He
knows his way home.

SAM
Goodbye, Bill.

ARAGORN
Do not disturb the water.

FRODO
It's a riddle.

FRODO
Speak, friend, and enter. What's the
Elvish for friend?

GANDALF
mellon.

STOP

GIMLI
So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled
hospitality of the dwarves; roaring
fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.
This, my friend, is the home of my
cousin, Balin, and they call this a
Mine. A mine!

BOROMIR
This is no mine. It's a tomb!

GIMLI
Oh no. No. No!

LEGOLAS
Goblins!

BOROMIR
We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should
never have come here.

GANDALF
Into the mines!

BOROMIR
Legolas!

GANDALF
We now have but one choice: We must face
the long dark of Moria. Be on your
guard! There are older and fouler things
than the Orcs in the deep places of the
world.

GANDALF
Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to
the other side. Let us hope that our
presence will go unnoticed.

STOP

GANDALF
I have no memory of this place.

PIPPIN
Are we lost?

MERRY
No. I don't think we are. Shhhh,
Gandalf's thinking.

PIPPIN
Merry!

MERRY
What?

PIPPIN
I'm hungry.

FRODO
There's something down there.

GANDALF
It's Gollum.

FRODO
Gollum!

GANDALF
He's been following us for three days.

FRODO
He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?

GANDALF
Escaped, or was set loose. And now the
Ring has drawn him here. He will never
be rid of his need for it. He hates and
loves the ring, as he hates and loves
himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story.

GANDALF
Yes, Smeagol he was once called. Before
the ring came to him, before it drove him
mad.

FRODO
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he
had the chance.

GANDALF
Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's
hand. Many that live deserve death, and
some that die deserve life. Can you give
it to them, Frodo?

GANDALF
Do not be too eager to deal out death in
judgment, even the very wise cannot see
all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum
has some part to play yet, for good or
ill, before this is over. The pity of
Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

FRODO
I wish the ring had never come to me.
I wish none of this had happened.

GANDALF
So do all who live to see such times, but
that is not for them to decide. All we
have to decide is what to do with the
time that is given to us.

GANDALF
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In
which case, you also were meant to have
it, and that is an encouraging thought.

GANDALF
Ah! That it's that way!

MERRY
He's remembered!

GANDALF
No, but the air doesn't smell so foul
down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose!

STOP

GANDALF
Let me risk a little more light.

GANDALF
Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city
of Dwarrowdelf!

SAM
Well, there's an eye opener and no
mistake!

GANDALF
Gimli!

GIMLI
No. No - oh, no!

GANDALF
"Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of
Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I had
feared.

LEGOLAS
We must move on, we cannot linger.

GANDALF
"They have taken the Bridge and the
second hall: We have barred the
gates, but cannot hold them for
long. The ground shakes. Drums in the
deep. We cannot get out. A shadow moves
in the dark. Will no-one save us? They
are coming."

GANDALF
Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next
time and rid us of your stupidity!

SAM
Mister Frodo!

LEGOLAS
Orcs !

ARAGORN
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.

BOROMIR
They have a cave troll!

GIMLI
Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in
Moria who still draws breath!

STOP

SAM
He's alive!

FRODO
I'm alright. I'm not hurt.

ARAGORN
You should be dead. That spear would've
skewered a wild boar!

GANDALF
I think there's more to this hobbit than
meets the eye.

GIMLI
Mithril! You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

GANDALF
To the bridge of Khazad-dum!

GANDALF
This way!

STOP

BOROMIR
What is this new devilry?

GANDALF
A Balrog. A demon of the ancient world!
This foe is beyond any of you!
Run! Quickly!

GANDALF
Lead them on, Aragorn. The bridge is
near.

GANDALF
Do as I say; swords are no more use here.

STOP

GANDALF
Over the bridge! Fly!

GANDALF
You cannot pass!

FRODO
Gandalf!

GANDALF
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark
fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!

GANDALF
Go back to the shadow!

GANDALF
You shall not pass!

FRODO
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Fly, you fools!

FRODO
No!

ARAGORN
Gandalf!

STOP

ARAGORN
Legolas, get them up!

BOROMIR
Give them a moment for pity's sake!

ARAGORN
By nightfall these hills will be swarming
with Orcs! We must reach the woods of
Lothlorien. Come, Boromir, Legolas,
Gimli, get them up. On your feet, Sam.

ARAGORN
Frodo? Frodo!

STOP

GIMLI
Stay close, young hobbits. They say a
Sorceress lives in these woods. An elf-
witch of terrible power. All who look
upon her fall under her spell.

GALADRIEL
Frodo.

GIMLI
And are never seen again!

GALADRIEL
Your coming to us is as the footsteps
of doom. You bring great evil here,
Ringbearer.

SAM
Mister Frodo?

GIMLI
Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare
so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and
the ears of a fox!

HALDIR
The dwarf breathes so loud we could have
shot him in the dark.

ARAGORN
Haldir of Lorien, we come here for your
help. We need your protection.

GIMLI
Aragorn! These woods are perilous. We
should go back.

HALDIR
You have entered the realm of the Lady of
the Wood. You cannot go back.

HALDIR
Come, she is waiting.

STOP

CELEBORN
Eight there are, yet nine there were set
out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is
Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with
him.

GALADRIEL
He has fallen into shadow.

GALADRIEL
The Quest stands upon the edge of a
knife. Stray but a little and it will
fail, to the ruin of all. Yet hope
remains while the company is true.

GALADRIEL
Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go
now and rest for you are weary with
sorrow and much toil.

GALADRIEL
Tonight you will sleep in peace.
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire.

GALADRIEL
The one who has seen the eye.

STOP

LEGOLAS
A lament for Gandalf.

MERRY
What do they say about him?

LEGOLAS
I have not the heart to tell you. For me,
the grief is still too near.

ARAGORN
Take some rest. These borders are well
protected.

BOROMIR
I will find no rest here. I heard her
voice inside my head. She spoke of my
father and the fall of Gondor, and she
said to me: "Even now, there is hope left."
But I cannot see it! It is long since
we had any hope.

BOROMIR
My father is a noble man, but his rule is
failing and our - our people lose faith.
He looks to me to make things right. And
I would do it, I would see the glory of
Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it,
Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion,
glimmering like a spike of pearl and
silver, its banners caught high in the
morning breeze. Have you ever been
called home by the clear ringing of
silver trumpets?

ARAGORN
I have seen the white city, long ago.

BOROMIR
One day our paths will lead us there, and
the tower guards shall take up the call
"the Lords of Gondor have returned."

STOP

GALADRIEL
Will you look into the mirror?

FRODO
What will I see?

GALADRIEL
Even the wisest cannot tell for the
mirror shows many things: Things that
were. Things that are. And some things
that have not yet come to pass.

STOP

GALADRIEL
I know what it is you saw, for it is
also in my mind. It is the future,
Frodo. It is what will come to pass if
you should fail.

GALADRIEL
The fellowship is breaking. It has
already begun. He will try to take the
ring. You know of whom I speak. One by
one, it will destroy them all.

FRODO
If you ask it of me, I will give you the
One Ring.

GALADRIEL
You offer it to me freely! I do not deny
that my heart has greatly desired this.

GALADRIEL
In place of the Dark Lord, you would have
a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and
terrible as the Dawn! Treacherous as the
Sea! Stronger than the foundations of
the earth! All shall love me and
despair!

GALADRIEL
I pass the test.
I will diminish and go into the west and
remain Galadriel.

FRODO
I cannot do this alone.

GALADRIEL
You are the ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear
a ring of power is to be alone. This task
was appointed to you, and if you do not
find a way, no one will.

FRODO
Then I know what I must do. It's
just: I'm afraid to do it.

GALADRIEL
Even the smallest person can change the
course of the future.

STOP

SARUMAN
Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?

SARUMAN
They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark
Powers, tortured and mutilated. A
ruined and terrible form of life. And
now, perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai.
Whom do you serve?

LURTZ
Saruman.

SARUMAN
Hunt them down. Do not stop until they
are found. You do not know pain. You do
not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.

SARUMAN
One of the Halflings carries something of
great value. Bring him to me, alive and
unspoiled. Kill the others.

STOP

GALADRIEL
Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the
light of Earendil, our most beloved star.

GALADRIEL
May it be a light for you in dark places,
when all other lights go out.

STOP

ARAGORN
The Argonath.

ARAGORN
Long have I desired to look upon the
kings of old. My kin.

ARAGORN
We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
boats and continue on foot. We approach
Mordor from the North.

GIMLI
Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable
labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And
after that gets even better! A
festering, stinking marshland, far as the
eye can see.

ARAGORN
That is our Road. I suggest you take
some rest and recover your strength,
Master Dwarf.

GIMLI
Recover my-

LEGOLAS
We should leave now.

ARAGORN
No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We
must wait for cover of darkness.

LEGOLAS
It is not the Eastern shore that worries
me.

LEGOLAS
A shadow and a threat has been growing in
my mind. Something draws near, I can
feel it.

MERRY
Where's Frodo?

STOP

BOROMIR
None of us should wander alone; you least
of all. So much depends on you. Frodo?

BOROMIR
I know why you seek solitude. You
suffer, I see it day by day. Are you
sure you do not suffer needlessly?

BOROMIR
Let me help you. There are other ways,
Frodo, other paths that we might take.

FRODO
I know what you would say, and it would
seem like wisdom but for the warning of
my heart.

BOROMIR
Warning? Against what?

BOROMIR
We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that
fear drive us to destroy what hope we
have. Don't you see that is madness?

FRODO
There is no other way.

BOROMIR
I ask only for the strength to defend my
people.
If you would but lend me the ring-

FRODO
No!

BOROMIR
Why do you recoil? I am no thief.

FRODO
You are not yourself.

BOROMIR
What chance do you think you have? They
will find you, they will take the ring
and you will beg for death before the
end.

BOROMIR
You fool! It is not yours save by
unhappy chance! It might have been mine.
It should be mine. Give it to me! Give
me the ring!

BOROMIR
I see your mind. You will take the ring
to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to
your death - and the death of us all!

BOROMIR
Curse you! Curse you and all the Halflings!

BOROMIR
Frodo! Frodo! What have I done. Please,
Frodo.

BOROMIR
I'm sorry, Frodo. Frodo-

STOP

ARAGORN
Frodo?

FRODO
It has taken Boromir.

ARAGORN
Where is the ring?

FRODO
Stay away!

ARAGORN
Frodo- I swore to protect you.

FRODO
Can you protect me from yourself?

FRODO
Would you destroy it?

ARAGORN
I would have gone with you to the end.
Into the very fires of Mordor.

FRODO
I know. Look after the others,
especially Sam, he will not understand.

ARAGORN
Go, Frodo!
Run, Run!

STOP

MERRY
Frodo!

MERRY
Hide here, quick!

PIPPIN
Come on.

PIPPIN
What's he doing?

MERRY
He's leaving.

PIPPIN
No!

MERRY
Pippin!

STOP

LEGOLAS
The horn of Gondor!

ARAGORN
Boromir!

BOROMIR
Run! Run!

MERRY & PIPPIN
Boromir! Boromir!

STOP

BOROMIR
They took the little ones.

BOROMIR
Frodo- where is Frodo?

ARAGORN
I let Frodo go.

BOROMIR
Then you did what I could not. I tried
to take the ring from him.

ARAGORN
The ring is beyond our reach now.

BOROMIR
Forgive me, I did not see. I have failed
you all.

ARAGORN
No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You
have kept your honor.

BOROMIR
Leave it! It is over, the world of Men
will fall and all will come to darkness
and my city to ruin. Aragorn-

ARAGORN
I do not know what strength is in my
blood, but I swear to you: I will not
let the White City fall, nor your people
fail.

BOROMIR
Our people. Our people.

BOROMIR
I would have followed you, my
brother, my captain, my King.

ARAGORN
Be at peace, son of Gondor.

ARAGORN
They will look for his coming from the
white tower, but he will not return.

STOP

SAM
Mister Frodo!

SAM
Not alone, Frodo. Mister Frodo!

FRODO
No, Sam.

FRODO
Go back, Sam. I'm going to Mordor alone.

SAM
Of course you are! And I'm coming with
you!

FRODO
You can't swim.

FRODO
Sam!

SAM
I made a promise, Mister Frodo, a promise.
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to. I don't mean to.

FRODO
Oh, Sam!

FRODO
Come on then.

STOP

LEGOLAS
If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and
Sam before nightfall.

LEGOLAS
You mean not to follow them.

ARAGORN
Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

GIMLI
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

ARAGORN
Not if we hold true to each other. We
will not abandon Merry and Pippin to
torment and death, not while we have
strength left.

ARAGORN
Leave all that can be spared behind.
We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.

GIMLI
Yes! Ha!

STOP

FRODO
Mordor! I hope the others find a safer
road.

SAM
Strider'll look after them.

FRODO
I don't suppose we'll ever see them
again.

SAM
We may yet, Mister Frodo. We may.

FRODO
Sam?

FRODO
I'm glad you're with me.

STOP

SAM
What is it, Mr Frodo?

FRODO
Nothing. Just a dream.

SAM
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer, and
the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get. Let's
face it, Mr Frodo, we're lost. I don't
think Gandalf meant for us to come this
way.

FRODO
He didn't mean for a lot of things to
happen, Sam, but they did.

SAM
Mr Frodo? It's the Ring, isn't it?

FRODO
It's getting heavier.

FRODO
What food have we got left?

SAM
Well, let me see. Oh yes, lovely! Lembas bread.
And look! More lembas bread.

SAM
I don't usually hold with foreign food,
but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

FRODO
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?

SAM
Those rain clouds might.

SAM
This looks strangely familiar.

FRODO
It's because we've been here before!
We're going in circles.

SAM
Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant
there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you
smell it?

FRODO
Yes. I can smell it. We're not alone.

STOP

GOLLUM
The thieves! The thieves! The filthy
little thieves! Where is it? Where isss
it? They stole it from us. My preciousss.
Curse them! We hates them!
It's ours, it is! And we wantssss it!

FRODO
This is Sting. You've seen it before, haven't you, Gollum!
Release him or I'll cut your throat!

STOP

GOLLUM
It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty
Elves twisted it. Take it off us!

SAM
Quiet you!

SAM
It's hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket! Let's just
tie him up and leave him.

GOLLUM
No! That would kill us! Kill us!

SAM
It's no more than you deserve!

FRODO
Maybe he does deserve to die, but now
that I see him, I do pity him.

GOLLUM
We be nice to them if they
be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears
to do what you wants. We swears.

FRODO
There's no promise you can make that
I can trust.

GOLLUM
We swears to serve the master of the
preciousss. We swears on - on the precious.
*Gollum, Gollum*

FRODO
The Ring is treacherous. It will hold
you to your word.

GOLLUM
Yes, on the preciousss. On the preciousss.

SAM
I don't believe you!
Get down! I said, down!

FRODO
Sam!

SAM
He's trying to trick us! We let him
go he'll throttle us in our sleep!

FRODO
You know the way to Mordor?

GOLLUM
Yes.

FRODO
You've been there before?

GOLLUM
Yes.

FRODO
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

STOP

PIPPIN
Merry. Merry!

UGLÚK
What is it? What do you smell?

MAN-FLESH URUK
Man-flesh.

PIPPIN
Aragorn!

UGLÚK
They've picked up our trail! Let's move!

ARAGORN
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent. Hurry!

LEGOLAS
Come on, Gimli!

GIMLI
Three days' and nights' pursuit. No food.
No rest. And no sign of our quarry but
what bare rock can tell.

ARAGORN
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

LEGOLAS
They may yet be alive.

ARAGORN
Less than a day ahead of us. Come!

LEGOLAS
Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!

GIMLI
I am wasted on cross-country!
We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very
dangerous over short distances!

ARAGORN
Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There
is something strange at work here. Some
evil gives speed to these creatures,
sets its will against us.

ARAGORN
Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?

LEGOLAS
The Uruks turn northeast. They're taking
the hobbits to Isengard!

ARAGORN
Saruman.

STOP

SARUMAN
The world is changing. Who now
has the strength to stand against the
armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand
against the might of Sauron and Saruman
and the union of the two towers?

SARUMAN
Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule
this Middle-earth.

SARUMAN
The old world will burn in the fires
of industry. The forests will fall.
A new order will rise. We will drive
the machine of war with the sword and
the spear and the iron fists of the
Orc. We have only to remove those who
oppose us.

STOP

SARUMAN
The horsemen took your land. They drove
your people into the hills to scratch
a living off rocks.

DUNLAND MAN
Murderers!

SARUMAN
Take back the lands they stole from
you! Burn every village!

DUNLAND CROWD
Argh!

SARUMAN
It will begin in Rohan. Too long have
these peasants stood against you. But
no more.

STOP

MORWEN
Éothain! Éothain! You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

FREDA
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf,
he is too big for him!

MORWEN
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm. Do you understand
me?

ÉOTHAIN
Yes, Ma!

FREDA
I don't wanna leave!
I don't wanna go, Mama!

MORWEN
Freda, I will find you there.

MORWEN
Quickly!

MORWEN
Go child!

SARUMAN
Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall.

STOP

EOWYN
Théodred!

EOWYN
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

EOMER
He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don't
defend our country, Saruman will take
it by force.

GRIMA
That is a lie!
Saruman the White has ever been our
friend and ally.

THEODEN
Grima, Grima.
My son? Grima?

EOMER
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at
will. Orcs bearing the white hand of
Saruman.

GRIMA
Why do you lay these troubles on an
already troubled mind. Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent,
your war-mongering.

EOMER
War-mongering?

EOMER
How long is it since Saruman bought
you? What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the men are dead you will take
your share of the treasure?

EOMER
Too long have you watched my sister,
too long have you haunted her steps.

GRIMA
You see much Eomer, Son of Éomund. Too
much. You are banished forthwith from the
kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death!

EOMER
Argh!

STOP

GIMLI
Keep breathing! That's the key! Breathe!
Ho!

LEGOLAS
They've run as if the very whips of
their masters were behind them.

STOP

MORDOR ORC
We're not going no further till we've
had a breather!

UGLÚK
Get a fire going!

PIPPIN
Merry! Merry!

MERRY
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

PIPPIN
What's making that noise?

MERRY
It's the trees.

PIPPIN
What?

MERRY
Do you remember the Old Forest? On the
borders of Buckland? Folk used to say
that there was something in the water
that made the trees grow tall, and
come alive.

PIPPIN
Alive?

MERRY
Trees that could whisper. Talk to each
other. Even move.

MAÚHUR
I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' but
maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!

SNAGA
Yeah. Why can't we have some meat?
What about them? They're fresh.

UGLÚK
They are not for eating!

GRISHNÁKH
What about their legs? They don't need
those. Ooh! Hey look tasty!

UGLÚK
Get back, scum!

MORDOR ORC
Carve them up!

SNAGA
Just a mouth full.

UGLÚK
No!

UGLÚK
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys!

MERRY
Pippin, let's go.

GRISHNÁKH
Go on, call for help. Squeal!
No one's gonna save you now!

MERRY
Pippin!

PIPPIN
ARGH!

STOP

LEGOLAS
A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night.

ARAGORN
Riders of Rohan, what news from the
Mark?

EOMER
What business does an Elf, a man and
a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak
quickly!

GIMLI
Give me your name, Horsemaster, and
I shall give you mine.

EOMER
I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if
it stood but a little higher from the
ground.

LEGOLAS
You would die before your stroke fell!

ARAGORN
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This
is Gimli, son of Glóin and Legolas of
the Woodland realm. We are friends of
Rohan and of Theoden, your king.

EOMER
Theoden no longer recognizes friend
from foe. Not even his own kin.

EOMER
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the
king and claimed lordship over these
lands. My company are those loyal to
Rohan. And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning. He walks
here and there, they say, as an old
man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere
his spies slip past our nets.

ARAGORN
We are not spies. We track a party of
Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They've taken two of our friends captive.

EOMER
The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered
them during the night.

GIMLI
But there were two hobbits. Did you
see two hobbits with them?

ARAGORN
They would be small – only children
to your eyes.

EOMER
We left none alive. We piled the carcasses
and burned them.

GIMLI
Dead?

EOMER
I am sorry.

EOMER
Hasufel! Arod!
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters. Farewell.

EOMER
Look for your friends. But do not trust
to hope, it has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!

STOP

GIMLI
It's one of their wee belts.

LEGOLAS
Hiro îth, ab 'wanath.
(May they find peace in death.)

ARAGORN
AAARRGGHH! *breaks his toe*

GIMLI
We failed them.

ARAGORN
A hobbit lay here, and the other.
They crawled.

ARAGORN
Their hands were bound. Their bonds
were cut.

ARAGORN
They ran over here. They were followed.

ARAGORN
The tracks lead away from the battle!
Into Fangorn Forest.

GIMLI
Fangorn. What madness drove them in
there?

STOP

PIPPIN
Did we lose him? I think
we lost him.

GRISHNÁKH
I'm gonna rip out your filthy little
innards! Come here!

MERRY
Trees! Climb a tree!

MERRY
He's gone.

PIPPIN
Merry!

TREEBEARD
Hooooo.

PIPPIN
Argh!

GRISHNÁKH
Let's put a maggot-hole in your belly.

PIPPIN
Run, Merry!

TREEBEARD
Little Orcs! Burárum!

PIPPIN
It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking!

TREEBEARD
Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent.

MERRY
A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.

PIPPIN
Don't talk to it, Merry. Don't encourage
it.

TREEBEARD
Treebeard, some call me.

PIPPIN
And whose side are you on?

TREEBEARD
Side? I am on nobody's side because
nobody's on my side, little Orc. Nobody
cares for the woods anymore.

MERRY
We're not Orcs. We're Hobbits!

TREEBEARD
Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire, they come with
axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking,
burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse
them!

MERRY
No, you don't understand. We're Hobbits!
Halflings! Shirefolk!

TREEBEARD
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.

PIPPIN
The White Wizard?

MERRY
Saruman.

STOP

GOLLUM
See, see, we have led you out! Hurry
hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find
you.

SAM
Whoa, it's a bog! He's led us into a
swamp!

GOLLUM
A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We
will take you on safe paths through
the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go
quickly.

GOLLUM
I found it, I did. The way through the
marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't
know it. They go round for miles and
miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick
as shadows we must be.

SAM
There are dead things! Dead faces in
the water!

GOLLUM
All dead. All rotten. Elves and men
and orcses. A great battle long ago.
The Dead Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name.
This way. Don't follow the lights.

SAM
Ohh!

GOLLUM
Careful now, or hobbits go down to join
the dead ones and light little candles
of their own.

STOP

SAM
Frodo!

FRODO
Gollum-

GOLLUM
Don't follow the lights!

SAM
Mr Frodo! Are you alright?

STOP

GOLLUM
Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful. Our preciousss.

FRODO
What did you say?

GOLLUM
Master should be resting. Master needs
to keep up his strength.

FRODO
Who are you?

GOLLUM
Mustn't ask us. Not its business. *Gollum,
Gollum*

FRODO
Gandalf told me you were one of the
River Folk.

GOLLUM
Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold
be travellers far from home.

FRODO
He said your life was a sad story.

GOLLUM
They do not see what lies ahead, when
sun has failed and moon is dead.

FRODO
You were not so very different from
a hobbit once, were you, Smeagol?

GOLLUM
What did you call me?

FRODO
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.

GOLLUM
My name. My name. S-Smeagol!

GOLLUM
Argh!

SAM
Black Riders!

GOLLUM
Hide! Hide!

FRODO
Argh!

SAM
C'mon Frodo! C'mon!

GOLLUM
Quick! They will see us! They will see
us!

SAM
I thought they were dead!

GOLLUM
Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.

GOLLUM
Wraiths! Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it. They are calling
for the preciousss.

SAM
Mr Frodo! It's alright. I'm here.

GOLLUM
Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very
close.

STOP

GIMLI
*spits out* Orc blood.

ARAGORN
These are strange tracks.

GIMLI
The air is so close in here.

LEGOLAS
This forest is old. Very old. Full of
memory and anger.

LEGOLAS
The trees are speaking to each other.

ARAGORN
Gimli!
Lower your axe.

LEGOLAS
Aragorn, nad nâ ennas!
(Something is out there.)

ARAGORN
Man cenich?
(What do you see?)

LEGOLAS
The White Wizard approaches.

ARAGORN
Do not let him speak. He will put a
spell on us.

ARAGORN
We must be quick.

STOP

WHITE WIZARD
You are tracking the footsteps of two
young hobbits.

ARAGORN
Where are they?

WHITE WIZARD
They passed this way the day before
yesterday. They met someone they did
not expect. Does that comfort you?

ARAGORN
Who are you? Show yourself!

ARAGORN
It cannot be. You fell.

GANDALF
Through fire and water. From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak, I fought with the
Balrog of Morgoth.

GANDALF
Until at last, I threw down my enemy
and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.

GANDALF
Darkness took me. And I strayed out
of thought and time. Stars wheeled
overhead and everyday was as long as
a life-age of the earth. But it was
not the end. I felt life in me again.

GANDALF
I've been sent back until my task is
done.

ARAGORN
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Gandalf? Yes- That's what they used
to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was
my name.

GIMLI
Gandalf!

GANDALF
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.

STOP

GANDALF
One stage of your journey is over, another
begins. War has come to Rohan. We must
ride to Edoras with all speed.

LEGOLAS
That is one of the Mearas, unless my
eyes are cheated by some spell.

GANDALF
Shadowfax.
He's the lord of all horses and he's
been my friend through many dangers.

STOP

TREEBEARD
My home lies deep in the forest near
the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf
I would keep you safe and safe is where
I'll keep you. The trees have grown
wild and dangerous. Anger festers in
their hearts. They will harm you if
they can. There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

STOP

GOLLUM
The Black Gate of Mordor.

SAM
Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing
or two to say if he could see us now.

GOLLUM
Master says to show him the way into
Mordor, so good Smeagol does. Master
says so.

FRODO
I did.

SAM
That's it then. We cannot get past that.

SAM
Look! The gate, it's opening! I can
see a way down.

FRODO
Sam, no!

SAM
Argh!

GOLLUM
Master!

STOP

FRODO
I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.

SAM
I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these
Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.

FRODO
Now!

GOLLUM
No! No, no master! They catch you! They
catch you! Don't take it to him! He
wants the preciousss. Always he's looking
for it! And the preciousss is wanting
to go back to him. But we mustn't let
him have it.

GOLLUM
No! There's
another way. More secret. A dark way.

SAM
Why haven't you spoken of this before?!

GOLLUM
Because Master did not ask!

SAM
He's up to something.

FRODO
Are you saying there's another way into
Mordor?

GOLLUM
Yes. There is a path, and some stairs,
and then, a tunnel.

FRODO
He's led us this far, Sam.

SAM
Mr Frodo, no.

FRODO
He's been true to his word.

SAM
No!

FRODO
Lead the way, Smeagol.

GOLLUM
Good Smeagol always helps.

STOP

GANDALF
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan,
whose mind is overthrown. Saruman's
hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

EOWYN
My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord?
Uncle?

EOWYN
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?

GANDALF
Be careful what you say. Do not look
for welcome here.

GRIMA
Oh, he must have died sometime in
the night. What a tragedy for the king
to lose his only son and heir.

GRIMA
I understand his passing is hard to
accept, especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

EOWYN
Leave me alone, snake!

GRIMA
Oh, but you are alone! Who
knows what you have spoken to the darkness.
In bitter watches of the night, when
all your life seems to shrink, the walls
of your bower closing in about you,
like a hutch to trammel some wild thing
in.

GRIMA
So fair, so cold, like a morning of
pale spring still clinging to winter's
chill.

EOWYN
Your words are poison!

STOP

GIMLI
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

HAMA
I cannot allow you before Theoden-King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order
of Grima Wormtongue.

HAMA
Your staff.

GANDALF
Hmm? Oh. You would not part an
old man from his walking stick?

GRIMA
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.

GANDALF
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat
lessened of late. Theoden King.

GRIMA
He's not welcome.

THEODEN
Why should I welcome you - Gandalf Stormcrow?

GRIMA
A just question, my liege. Late is the hour in
which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news
is an ill guest.

GANDALF
Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind
you teeth. I have not passed through
fire and death to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm!

GRIMA
His staff! I told you to take the wizard's staff!

GANDALF
Theoden, son of Thengel, too long have
you sat in the shadows.

GIMLI
I would stay still, if I were
you.

GANDALF
Hearken to me! I release you from the
spell.

THEODEN
Hahahhhahahahah! You have
no power here, Gandalf the Grey!
Argh!

GANDALF
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison
is drawn from a wound.

THEODEN
If I go, Theoden dies.

GANDALF
You did not kill me, you will not kill
him!

THEODEN
Rohan is mine!

GANDALF
Be gone!

STOP

THEODEN
I know your face. Eowyn - Eowyn!

THEODEN
Gandalf?

GANDALF
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

THEODEN
Dark have been my dreams of late.

GANDALF
Your fingers would remember their old
strength better, if they grasped your
sword.

GRIMA
Argh! I've only ever served you, my lord!

THEODEN
Your leechcraft
would have had me crawling on all fours
like a beast!

GRIMA
Send me not from your side.

ARAGORN
No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilled on his
account.

GRIMA
Get out of my way!

HAMA
Hail, Theoden king!

THEODEN
Where is Théodred? Where is my son?

STOP

THEODEN
Simbelmynë. Ever has it grown on the
tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas, that these evil days should be
mine. The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days
of my house.

GANDALF
Théodred's death was not of your making.

THEODEN
No parent should have to bury their
child.

GANDALF
He was strong in life. His spirit will
find its way to the halls of your fathers.
Westu hál. Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu.
(Be-thou well. Go-thou, Théodred, go-thou.)

STOP

EOWYN
They had no warning. They were unarmed.
Now the wildmen are moving through the
Westfold, burning as they go. Rick,
cot and tree.

FREDA
Where's mama?

EOWYN
Shh.

GANDALF
This is but a taste of the terror that
Saruman will unleash. All the more potent
for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on. Draw
him away from your women and children.
You must fight.

ARAGORN
You have two thousand good men riding
north as we speak. Eomer is loyal to
you. His men will return and fight for
their king.

THEODEN
They will be three hundred leagues from
here by now. Eomer cannot help us. I
know what it is that you want of me.
But I will not bring further death to
my people. I will not risk open war.

ARAGORN
Open war is upon you. Whether you would
risk it or not.

THEODEN
When last I looked, Theoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

GANDALF
Then what is the king's decision?

STOP

HAMA
By order of the king, the city must
empty. We make for the refuge of Helm's
Deep. Do not burden yourselves with
treasures. Take only what provisions
you need.

GIMLI
Helm's Deep! They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight. Who
will defend them if not their king?

ARAGORN
He's only doing what he thinks is best
for his people. Helm's Deep has saved
them in the past.

GANDALF
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap. He thinks
he's leading them to safety. What they
will get is a massacre. Theoden has
a strong will but I fear for him. I
fear for the survival of Rohan. He will
need you before the end, Aragorn. The
people of Rohan will need you. The defences
HAVE to hold.

ARAGORN
They will hold.

GANDALF
The Grey Pilgrim, that's what they
used to call me. Three hundred lives
of men I've walked this earth and now
I have no time. With luck, my search
will not be in vain. Look to my coming
at first light on the fifth day. At
dawn, look to the East.

ARAGORN
Go.

STOP

ARAGORN
You have some skill with a blade.

EOWYN
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords may still die upon
them. I fear neither death nor pain.

ARAGORN
What do you fear, my lady?

EOWYN
A cage. To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them and all chance
of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.

ARAGORN
You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden
of Rohan. I
do not think that would be your fate.

STOP

GRIMA
Theoden will not stay at Edoras. It's
vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect
an attack on the city. They will flee
to Helm's Deep, the great fortress of
Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains. They will be
slow. They will have women and children
with them.

SARUMAN
Send out your warg riders.

STOP

SAM
Hey Stinker! Don't go getting too far
ahead!

FRODO
Why do you do that?

SAM
What?

FRODO
Call him names; run him down all the
time.

SAM
Because - because that's what he is,
Mr Frodo. There's naught left in 'im
but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he
wants. It's all he cares about.

FRODO
You have no idea what
it did to him. What it's still doing
to him.
I want to help him, Sam.

SAM
Why?

FRODO
Because I have to believe he can come
back.

SAM
You can't save him, Mr Frodo.

FRODO
What do you know about
it? Nothing!

FRODO
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't
know why I said that.

SAM
I do. It's the Ring. You can't
take your eyes off it. I've seen you.
You're not eating. You barely sleep.
It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo.
You have to fight it!

FRODO
I know what I have
to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to
me! It's my task! Mine! My own!

SAM
Can't you hear yourself? Don't you know
who you sound like?

STOP

GOLLUM
We wants it. We needs it. Must have
the precioussss. They stole it from
us. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked,
trickssssy, falssse!

SMEAGOL
No! Not Master.

GOLLUM
Yes, precious. False. They will cheat
you, hurt you, lie.

SMEAGOL
Master's my friend.

GOLLUM
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes YOU!

SMEAGOL
Not listening. I'm
not listening.

GOLLUM
You're a liar and a thief.

SMEAGOL
Nope.

GOLLUM
Murderer!

SMEAGOL
Go away.

GOLLUM
Go away?
HAHAHAHA!

SMEAGOL
I hate you. I hate you!

GOLLUM
Where would you be without
me? *Gollum, Gollum*. I saved us. It
was me. We survived because of me!

SMEAGOL
Not anymore.

GOLLUM
What did you say?

SMEAGOL
Master looks after us now. We don't
need you.

GOLLUM
What?

SMEAGOL
Leave now and never come back.

GOLLUM
No!

SMEAGOL
Leave now and never come back!

GOLLUM
Arrrgh!

SMEAGOL
LEAVE NOW AND NEVER COME BACK!

SMEAGOL
We- we told him to go away! And away
he goes, preciousss. Gone,
gone, gone! Smeagol is free!

STOP

SMEAGOL
Look! Look! See what Smeagol finds!
Hehehe! Hahaha!

SMEAGOL
They are young. They are tender. They
are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat
them!

SAM
You'll make him sick, you will, behaving
like that!
There's only one way to eat a brace
of coneys.

STOP

SMEAGOL
Argh! What's it doing!
Stupid fat hobbit! It ruins it!

SAM
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on ‘em.

SAM
What we need is a few good taters.

GOLLUM
What's taters, preciousss? What's taters
uh?

SAM
PO-TAY-TOES! Boil ‘em. Mash ‘em. Stick
‘em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

SMEAGOL
Pbbbttt!

SAM
Even you couldn't say no to that.

SMEAGOL
Oh yes we could! Spoil nice fish!
Give it to usss rrraw - and wrrriggling!
You keep nasty chips.

SAM
You're hopeless.

STOP

SAM
Who are they?

GOLLUM
Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They
are called to Mordor. The Dark One is
gathering all armies to him. It won't
be long now. He will soon be ready.

SAM
Ready to do what?

GOLLUM
To make his war. The last war that will
cover all the world in shadow.

FRODO
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

SAM
Mr Frodo!
Look! It's an Oliphaunt!

SAM
No one at home will believe this.

FRODO
Smeagol?

FRODO
We've lingered here too long. Come on,
Sam!

SAM
Ah!

FARAMIR
Bind their hands.

STOP

GIMLI
It's true you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice
and appearance, *laughs* that they're often
mistaken for Dwarf men!

ARAGORN
It's the beards!

GIMLI
And this, in turn, has given rise to
the belief that there are no Dwarf women.
And that dwarves just spring out of
holes in the ground!

EOWYN
Hahahaha!

GIMLI
Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous!
Whoa!

EOWYN
Ooh!

GIMLI
It's alright, it's alright.
Nobody panic. That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

STOP

ARWEN
The light of the Evenstar does not wax
and wane. It is mine to give to whom
I will, like my heart. Go to sleep.

ARAGORN
I am asleep. This is a dream.

ARWEN
Then it is a good dream. Sleep.

ARAGORN
Min lû pennich nin i aur hen telitha.
(You told me once that this day would
come.)

ARWEN

That is your path.)

trust this. Trust us.)

STOP

ELROND
Our time here is ending. Arwen's time
is ending. Let her go. Let her take
the ship into the west. Let her bear
away her love for you to the Undying
Lands. There it will be evergreen.

ARAGORN
But never more than a memory.

ELROND
I will not leave my daughter here to
die.

ARAGORN
She stays because she still has hope.

ELROND
She stays for YOU! She belongs with
her people!

ARAGORN
Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae o

for another life. Away from war, grief, despair.)

ARWEN
Why are you saying this?

ARAGORN
I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was
a dream, Arwen, nothing more.

ARAGORN
This belongs to you.

ARWEN
It was a gift. Keep it.

STOP

EOWYN
Where is she? The woman who gave you
that jewel.

EOWYN
My lord?

ARAGORN
She is sailing to the Undying Lands,
with all that is left of her kin.

GAMLING
What is it? Hama?

HAMA
I'm not sure.

GAMLING
Wargs!

LEGOLAS
Argh! A scout!

THEODEN
What is it? What do you see?

ARAGORN
Wargs! We
are under attack!

ARAGORN
Get them out of here!

THEODEN
All riders to the head of the column!

GIMLI
Come on, get
me up here, I'm a rider!

THEODEN
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep. And make haste!

EOWYN
I can fight!

THEODEN
No! You must do this. For me.

THEODEN
Follow me! Yah!

GIMLI
Forward.
I mean, charge forward! March forward!
That's it! Go on!

EOWYN
Make for the lower
ground! Stick together!

WARG-RIDERS
Argh!

THEODEN
CHARGE!

GIMLI
Bring your pretty face to my axe!

GIMLI
That one counts as mine!

GIMLI
Stinking creature. Argh!

STOP

GIMLI
Tell me
what happened and I will ease your passing.

SHARKU
He's dead. Took
a little tumble off the cliff.

LEGOLAS
You lie!

THEODEN
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.

THEODEN
Come.

STOP

REFUGEES
Helm's Deep! At last! There it is!

OLD WOMAN
We're safe, my lady! Thank
you!

FREDA
Mama!

MORWEN
Éothain! Freda!

GAMLING
Make way for Theoden!
Make way for the king!

EOWYN
So few. So few of you
have returned.

THEODEN
Our people are safe. We
have paid for it with many lives.

GIMLI
My lady.

EOWYN
Lord Aragorn, where is he?

GIMLI
He fell.

STOP

THEODEN
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate, and set a watch on the
surround.

GAMLING
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

THEODEN
Get them into the caves. Saruman's
arm would have grown long indeed if
he thinks he can reach us here.

STOP

GRIMA
Helm's Deep has one weakness. Its outer
wall is solid rock but for a small culvert
at its base which is little more than
a drain.

GRIMA
How? How can fire undo stone? What kind
of device could bring down the wall?

SARUMAN
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep
will fall.

GRIMA
Even if it is breached,
it would take a number beyond reckoning,
thousands to storm the keep.

SARUMAN
Tens of thousands.

GRIMA
But, my lord, there is no such force.

SARUMAN
A new power is rising. Its victory is
at hand!

SARUMAN
This night, the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms
Deep! Leave none alive!

SARUMAN
To war!

SARUMAN
There will be no dawn for Men.

STOP

PIPPIN
Look! There's smoke to the south!

TREEBEARD
There is always smoke rising from Isengard
these days.

MERRY
Isengard?

TREEBEARD
There was a time when Saruman would
walk in my woods. But now he has a mind
of metal and wheels. He no longer cares
for growing things.

PIPPIN
What is it?

MERRY
It's Saruman's army! The war has started.

STOP

ARWEN
May the grace
of the Valar protect you.

ARAGORN
Brego-

STOP

ELROND
Arwen.

ELROND
Tollen i lû. I chair gwannar na Valannor.
Si bado, no círar. (Arwen, it is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go
now, before it is too late.)

ARWEN
I have made my choice.

ELROND
He is not coming back. Why do you linger
here when there is no hope?

ARWEN
There is still hope.

ELROND
If Aragorn survives this war, you will
still be parted. If Sauron is defeated,
and Aragorn made king and all that you
hope for comes true, you will still
have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay
of time, Aragorn will die.

ELROND
And there will be no comfort for you.
No comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death, an image of the
splendor of the kings of men in glory
undimmed before the breaking of the
world.

ELROND
But you, my daughter, you will linger
on in darkness and in doubt. As nightfall
in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell, bound to your grief,
under the fading trees, until all the
world is changed and the long years
of your life are utterly spent.

ELROND
Arwen. There is
nothing for you here, only death.

ELROND
A im, ú-'erin veleth lîn?
(Do I not also have your love?)

ARWEN
Gerich meleth nîn, ada.

I amar prestar aen. Han mathon ne

I feel it in the water, I feel it in
the earth, I smell it in the air.)

GALADRIEL
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy
the people of Rohan. Isengard has been unleashed.
The eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last
free kingdom of men.

GALADRIEL
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close. The strength
of the Ringbearer is failing. In his
heart, Frodo begins to understand. The quest will claim his
life. You know this. You have foreseen
it. It is the risk we all took.

GALADRIEL
In the gathering dark, the will of the
Ring grows strong. It works hard now
to find its way back into the hands
of men.

GALADRIEL
Men, who are so easily seduced by its
power. The young captain of Gondor has
but to extend his hands, take the Ring
for his own and the world will fall.
It is close now, so close to achieving
its goal.

GALADRIEL
For Sauron will have dominion of all
life on this Earth, even unto the ending
of the world. The time of the Elves
is over.

GALADRIEL
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?

STOP

FARAMIR
What news?

MADRIL
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked
Rohan. Theoden's people have fled to
Helm's Deep. But
we must look to our own borders. Faramir,
Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling
an army. Easterlings and Southrons are
passing through the Black Gate.

FARAMIR
How many?

MADRIL
Some thousands. More come every day.

FARAMIR
Who's covering the river to the north?

MADRIL
We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but
if the city is attacked, we won't hold
it.

FARAMIR
Saruman attacks
from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The
fight will come to men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us
soon. And he will strike hard. He knows
now we do not have the strength to repel
him.

FARAMIR
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

SAM
Spies?! Now wait just a minute!

FARAMIR
Well if you're not spies, then who are
you?

FARAMIR
Speak.

FRODO
We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins
is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.

FARAMIR
Your bodyguard?

SAM
His gardener.

FARAMIR
And where is your skulking friend? That
gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured
look.

FRODO
There was no other.

FRODO
We set out from Rivendell with seven
companions. One we lost in Mória. Two
were my kin. A Dwarf there was also,
and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son
of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

FARAMIR
You're a friend of Boromir?

FRODO
Yes - for my part.

FARAMIR
It will grieve you then to learn that
he is dead.

FRODO
Dead? How? When?

FARAMIR
As one of his companions, I'd hoped
you would tell me. He was my
brother.

GONDORIAN RANGER
Captain Faramir. We found
the third one.

FARAMIR
You must come with me. Now.

STOP

FARAMIR
Down there.

FARAMIR
To enter the forbidden pool bears the
penalty of death. They wait for
my command.

FARAMIR
Shall I shoot?

GOLLUM
The rock and pool is nice
and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish
to catch a fish , so juicy sweet!

FRODO
Wait! This creature
is bound to me. And I to him. He is
our guide. Please, let me go down to
him.

STOP

FRODO
Smeagol. Master is here. Come, Smeagol.
Trust master. Come!

GOLLUM
We must go now?

FRODO
Smeagol, you must trust master. Follow
me, come on. Come. Come, Smeagol. Nice
Smeagol. That's it. Come on.

FRODO
Don't hurt him! Smeagol don't struggle!
Smeagol listen to me!

GOLLUM
Master!
No! No!

STOP

FARAMIR
Where are you leading them? Answer me!

GOLLUM
Sméa-gol. Why does it cry, Smeagol?

SMEAGOL
Cruel men hurts us. Master trickst us.

GOLLUM
Of course he did. I told you he was
tricksy. I told you he was false.

SMEAGOL
Master is our friend. Our friend!

GOLLUM
Master betrayed us.

SMEAGOL
No, not its business. Leave us alone!

GOLLUM
Filthy little hobbitses.
They stole it from us.

SMEAGOL
No. No!

FARAMIR
What did they steal?

GOLLUM
Myyy - PRECIOUSSS!
Aaaarrrggghhh!

STOP

SAM
We have to get out of here. You go.
Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring,
Mr Frodo. Just this once. Put it on.
Disappear.

FRODO
I can't. You were right, Sam. You tried
to tell me, but - I'm sorry. The Ring's
taking me Sam. If I put it on, he'll
find me. He'll see.

FARAMIR
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the wild I have you. Two halflings
and a host of men at my call. The Ring
of power within my grasp.

FARAMIR
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

FRODO
No!

SAM
Stop it! Leave him alone! Don't you
understand? He's got to destroy it.
That's where we're going. Into Mordor.
To the mountain of fire.

DAMROD
Osgiliath is under attack. They call
for reinforcements.

SAM
Please. It's such a burden. Will you
not help him?

DAMROD
Captain?

FARAMIR
Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to
Gondor.

STOP

ARAGORN
Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.
(Well done, Brego, my friend.)

REFUGEES
He's alive!

GIMLI
Where is he? Where is he? Get out of
the way. I'm gonna kill him! You are the luckiest, the
canniest and the most reckless man I
ever knew! Bless
you, laddie!

ARAGORN
Gimli, where is the king?

LEGOLAS
Le ab-dollen. (You're late.) You look terrible.

ARAGORN
Hannon le. (Thank you.)

THEODEN
A great host, you say?

ARAGORN
All Isengard is emptied.

THEODEN
How many?

ARAGORN
Ten thousand strong at least.

THEODEN
Ten thousand?!

ARAGORN
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
to destroy the world of men. They will
be here by nightfall.

THEODEN
Let them come!

THEODEN
I want every man and strong
lad able to bear arms to be ready for
battle by nightfall.

THEODEN
We will cover the causeway and the gate
from above. No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall or set foot inside
the Hornburg.

GIMLI
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick
and their shields broad.

THEODEN
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.

THEODEN
They will break upon this fortress like
water on rock. Saruman's hordes will
pillage and burn, we've seen it before.
Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt.
Within these walls, we will outlast
them.

ARAGORN
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages. They come to destroy
its people. Down to the last child.

THEODEN
What would
you have me do? Look at my men. Their
courage hangs by a thread. If this is
to be our end, then I would have them
make such an end as to be worthy of
remembrance.

ARAGORN
Send out riders, my lord. You must call
for aid.

THEODEN
And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We
are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.

ARAGORN
Gondor will answer.

THEODEN
Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold
fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies
closed in around us? Where was Gon –
No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone.
Get the women and children into the
caves.

GAMLING
We need more time to lay provisions
for a siege, lord-

THEODEN
There is no time. War is upon us!

ROHAN CAPTAIN
Secure the gate!

STOP

TREEBEARD
We Ents have not troubled about the
wars of men and wizards for a very long
time. But now something is about to
happen that has not happened for an
age: Ent Moot.

MERRY
What's that?

TREEBEARD
'Tis a gathering.

MERRY
A gathering of what?

TREEBEARD
Beech, oak, chestnut, ash. Good, good,
good. Many have come. Now we must decide
if the Ents will go to war.

STOP

ARAGORN
Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These
are no soldiers.

GIMLI
Most have seen too many winters.

LEGOLAS
Or too few. Look at them. They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes. Boe a hûn: neled herain

Three hundred against ten thousand!)

ARAGORN
Si beriathar hýn. Amar nâ ned Edoras.

here than at Edoras.)

LEGOLAS
Aragorn, men i ndagor. Hýn ú- ortheri.

They cannot win this fight. They are
all going to die!)

ARAGORN
Then I shall die as one them!

GIMLI
Let him go,
lad. Let him be.

STOP

GAMLING
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armory. My lord?

THEODEN
Who am I, Gamling?

GAMLING
You are our king, sire.

THEODEN
And do you trust your king?

GAMLING
Your men, my lord, will
follow you to whatever end.

THEODEN
To whatever end. Where is the horse
and the rider? Where is the horn that
was blowing? They have passed like rain
on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the west.
Behind the hills, into shadow. How did
it come to this?

STOP

ARAGORN
Give me your sword. What is your name?

HALETH
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord. The men
are saying that we will not live out
the night. They say that it is hopeless.

ARAGORN
This is a good sword, Haleth, son of
Hama.

ARAGORN
There is always hope.

STOP

LEGOLAS
We have trusted you this far. You have
not led us astray. Forgive me. I was
wrong to despair.

ARAGORN
Ú-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing
to forgive, Legolas.)

GIMLI
If we had more time I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.

LEGOLAS
That is no Orc horn.

BEREG
Send for the king.
Open the gate!

SOLDIER
Open the gate!

STOP

THEODEN
How is this possible?

HALDIR
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves
and men. Long ago we fought and died
together. We come to honor that allegiance.

ARAGORN
Mae govannen, Haldir.
(Welcome, Haldir.)

ARAGORN
You are most welcome!

HALDIR
We are proud to
fight alongside men, once more.

STOP

GIMLI
You could have picked a better
spot.

GIMLI
Well lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

LEGOLAS
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

GIMLI
Let's hope they last the night.

ARAGORN
A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn an
uben tanatha le faelas! (Show them no
mercy! For you shall receive none!)

GIMLI
What's
happening out there?

LEGOLAS
Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like
me to find you a box?

GIMLI
Hehehehe!

ARAGORN
Dartho! (Hold!)

THEODEN
So it begins.

ARAGORN
Tangado halad! (Prepare to fire!)

LEGOLAS
Faeg i-varv dîn na lanc a nu ranc. (Their
armor is weak at the neck and beneath
the arms.)

ARAGORN
Leithio i philinn! (Release the arrows!)

GIMLI
Did they hit anything?

THEODEN
Give them a volley.

GAMLING
Fire!

STOP

GIMLI
Legolas, two already!

LEGOLAS
I'm on seventeen!

GIMLI
Argh! I'll have no pointy-ear
outscoring me!

LEGOLAS
Nineteen!

STOP

PIPPIN
Merry!

TREEBEARD
We have just agreed.

MERRY
Yes?

TREEBEARD
I have told your names to the Ent moot
and we have agreed – you are not Orcs.

PIPPIN
Well, that's good news.

MERRY
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about HIM?

TREEBEARD
Now don't be hasty,
Master Meriadoc.

MERRY
Hasty? Our friends are out there! They
need our help! They cannot fight this
war on their own.

TREEBEARD
War, yes. It affects us all. But you
must understand, young hobbit. It takes
a loong time to say anything in ooold -
Entish. And we never say anything -
unless it is worth taking
a looong time to say.

STOP

GIMLI
Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!
Twenty-one! Twenty-two!

ARAGORN
Na fennas! (Causeway!)

THEODEN
Is this it? Is this all you can conjure,
Saruman?

ARAGORN
Togo hon dad, Legolas! (Bring him down,
Legolas!) Dago hon! Dago hon! (Kill him!
Kill him!)

THEODEN
Brace the Gate! Hold them! Stand firm!

GIMLI
Aragorn! Argh!

ARAGORN
Gimli! Hado i philinn! (Hurl the arrows!)

ARAGORN
Herio! (Charge!)

STOP

TREEBEARD
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have
always done.

MERRY
How can that be your decision?!

TREEBEARD
This is not our war.

MERRY
But you're part of this world! Aren't
you?! You must help, please! You
must do something!

TREEBEARD
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.

PIPPIN
Maybe Treebeard's right. We don't belong
here, Merry. It's too big for us. What
can we do in the end? We've got the
Shire. Maybe we should go home.

MERRY
The fires
of Isengard will spread. And the woods
of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

STOP

GAMLING
Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get
your men out of there!

ARAGORN
Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad!
(To the Keep! Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir, to the Keep!)

GIMLI
What are you doing? Argh!
What are you stopping for!

ARAGORN
HALDIR!

STOP

THEODEN
To the gate! Draw
your swords!

GAMLING
Make way! We cannot hold much longer.

ARAGORN
How long do
you need?

THEODEN
As long as you can give me!

THEODEN
Brace the Gate!

GIMLI
Come on! We can take ‘em!

ARAGORN
It's a long way.

GIMLI
Toss me.

ARAGORN
What?

GIMLI
I cannot jump the distance! You'll have
to toss me!

GIMLI
Oh! Don't tell the Elf.

ARAGORN
Not a word.

STOP

THEODEN
Pull everybody back! Pull them back!

THEODEN
They've broken through! The castle is
breached. Retreat!

GAMLING
Fall back!

THEODEN
Retreat!

ARAGORN
Hurry! Inside! Get them inside!

GAMLING
Into the Keep!

STOP

TREEBEARD
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest. You can make your way
north to your homeland from there.

PIPPIN
Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take
us south!

TREEBEARD
South? But that will lead you past Isengard.

PIPPIN
Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can
slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer
we are to danger, the farther we are
from harm. It's the last thing he'll
expect.

TREEBEARD
Mmmm. That doesn't make sense to me.
But then, you are very small. Perhaps
you're right. South it is then. Hold
on, little Shirelings. I always like
going south. Somehow it feels like going
down hill.

MERRY
Are you mad? We'll be caught!

PIPPIN
No we won't. Not this time.

STOP

RANGER 1
Look! Osgiliath burns!

RANGER 2
Mordor has come.

FRODO
The Ring will
not save Gondor. It has only the power
to destroy. Please, let me go.

FARAMIR
Hurry.

FRODO
Faramir, you must let me go!

STOP

TREEBEARD
And a little family of field mice that
climb up sometimes and they tickle me
awfully. They're always trying to get
somewhere where they – Oh!

TREEBEARD
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.

PIPPIN
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

TREEBEARD
They had voices
of their own.
Saruman! A wizard should know better!

TREEBEARD
There is no curse in Elvish, Entish
or the tongues of men for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight.
With rock and stone!

MERRY
Yes!

TREEBEARD
Hoorarooom. Come my friends. The Ents
are going to war. It is likely that
we go to our doom. Last march of the
Ents!

STOP

MADRIL
Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we'll be overrun.

SAM
Mr Frodo!

FRODO
It's calling to him, Sam. His eye is
almost on me.

SAM
Hold on, Mr Frodo. You'll be alright.

FARAMIR
Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir
sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will
change our fortunes in this war.

SAM
Do you want to know what happened to
Boromir? You want to know why your brother
died? He tried to take the Ring from
Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect
him, he tried to kill him! The Ring
drove your brother mad!

RANGER
Watch out!

SAM
Mr Frodo?

FRODO
They're here. They've
come.

FARAMIR
NAZGÛL!
Stay here. Keep out of sight. Take cover!

STOP

THEODEN
The fortress is taken. It is over.

ARAGORN
You said this
fortress would never fall while your
men defend it! They still defend it!
They have died defending it!

ARAGORN
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?

GAMLING
There is one passage. It leads into
the mountains. But they will not get
far. The Uruk-hai are too many.

ARAGORN
Send word for the women and children
to make for the mountain pass. And barricade
the entrance.

THEODEN
So much death. What can men do against
such reckless hate?

ARAGORN
Ride out with me. Ride out and
meet them.

THEODEN
For death and glory.

ARAGORN
For Rohan. For your people.

GIMLI
The sun is rising.

GANDALF
Look to my coming at first light on
the fifth day. At dawn, look to the
east.

THEODEN
Yes. Yes! The horn of Helm Hammerhand
shall sound in the deep one last time!

GIMLI
Yes!

THEODEN
Let this be the hour when we draw swords
together. Fell deeds awake. Now for
wrath! Now for ruin! And a red dawn!

THEODEN
FORTH EORLINGAS!

STOP

ARAGORN
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Theoden king stands alone.

EOMER
Not alone. Rohirrim!

THEODEN
Eomer!

EOMER
To the king!

STOP

THEODEN
Victory! We have victory!

STOP

PIPPIN
Yes!

TREEBEARD
A hit. A fine hit!

TREEBEARD
Break the dam! Release the river!

MERRY
Pippin, hold on!

TREEBEARD
Hold on, little hobbits!

STOP

SAM
What are you doing? Where are you going?!

FRODO
Aaarrgghh!

SAM
It's me. It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?

FRODO
I can't do
this, Sam.

SAM
I know. It's all wrong. By rights we
shouldn't even be here. But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end.
Because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it
was when so much bad had happened?

SAM
But in the end, it's only a passing
thing, this shadow. Even darkness
must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines
it will shine out the clearer. Those
were the stories that stayed with you.
That meant something, even if you were
too small to understand why. But I think,
Mr Frodo, I do understand. I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances
of turning back only they didn't. They
kept going because they were holding
on to something.

FRODO
What are we holding on to, Sam?

SAM
There's some good in this world, Mr
Frodo. And it's worth fighting for.

FARAMIR
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

MADRIL
You know the laws of our country, the
laws of your father. If you let them
go, your life will be forfeit.

FARAMIR
Then it is forfeit. Release them.

STOP

GANDALF
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his
retribution swift. The battle for Helm's
Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin. All our hopes now
lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere
in the wilderness.

STOP

SAM
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs
or tales.

FRODO
What?

SAM
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring." And they'll say:
"Yes, that's one of my favorite stories.
Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, dad."
"Yes, my boy, the most famousest of hobbits. And that's saying alot."

FRODO
Huh, you left out one of the chief characters:
Samwise the Brave. I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.

SAM
Now Mr Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

FRODO
So was I.

SAM
Samwise the Brave.

FRODO
Smeagol!

SAM
We're not gonna wait for you. Come on!

SMEAGOL
Master - Master looks after us. Master
wouldn't hurt us.

GOLLUM
Master broke his promise.

SMEAGOL
Don't ask Smeagol. Poor, poor Smeagol.

GOLLUM
Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy,
false. We ought to wring his filthy
little neck. Kill him! Kill him! Kill them
both. And then we take the precious
and we be the master.

SMEAGOL
The fat hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.

GOLLUM
Then we stabs them out. Put out his
eyeses. And make HIM crawl.

SMEAGOL
Yes! Yes! Yes!

GOLLUM
Kill them both.

SMEAGOL
Yes! No no!
It's too risky, it's too risky.

SAM
Where's he gone? Hey Gollum, where are
you?

FRODO
Smeagol?

GOLLUM
We could let HER do it.

SMEAGOL
Yes. She could do it.

GOLLUM
Yes, precious she could. And then we
takes it once they're dead.

SMEAGOL
Once they're dead-

GOLLUM
Shh!

SMEAGOL
Come on, hobbits. Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.

GOLLUM
Follow me.

STOP

DEAGOL
Smeagol, I've got one!
I've got a fish, Smeagol!

SMEAGOL
Go on, pull it in.

SMEAGOL
Deagol!

STOP

SMEAGOL
Give us that, Deagol, my love!

DEAGOL
Why?

SMEAGOL
Because its my birthday, and I wants it.

SMEAGOL
My precious!

STOP

SMEAGOL
They cursed us. Murderer. Murderer they
called us. They cursed us and drove us
away.

SMEAGOL
And we wept, Precious, we wept to be so
alone. And we forgot the taste of bread,
the sound of trees, the softness of the
wind. We even forgot our own name.
Gollum! Gollum!

GOLLUM
It's mine! My own. It came to me.

SMEAGOL
My Precious.

STOP

GOLLUM
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We
must go, yes, we must go at once!

SAM
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo?

SAM
I've gone and had too much!

SAM
It must be getting late.

FRODO
No, no it isn't. It isn't midday yet.
The days are growing darker.

GOLLUM
Come on, must go, no time!

SAM
Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.

GOLLUM
- no time to lose, silly!

SAM
Here.

FRODO
What about you?

SAM
I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas
bread.

FRODO
Sam.

SAM
Alright. We don't have that much left.
We have to be careful or we're going to run
out. You go ahead and eat that, Mr Frodo.
I've rationed it. There should be enough.

FRODO
For what?

SAM
The journey home.

STOP

GOLLUM
Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close
to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry!
Shhh.

STOP

PIPPIN
I feel like I'm back at the Green Dragon,
after a hard days work.

MERRY
Only, you've never done a hard days work.

STOP

MERRY
Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard.

GIMLI
You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led
us on, and now we find you feasting and
smoking.

PIPPIN
We are sitting on a field of victory,
enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
The salted pork is particularly good.

GIMLI
Salted pork?

GANDALF
Hobbits!

MERRY
We're under orders from Treebeard, who's
taken over management of Isengard.

STOP

TREEBEARD
Huraroom. Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad
you've come. Wood and water, stock and ,
stone I can master, but there's a wizard to
be managed here. Locked in his tower.

GANDALF
And there Saruman must remain, under your
guard, Treebeard.

GIMLI
Let's just have his head and be done with
it!

GANDALF
No. He has no power any more.

TREEBEARD
The filth of Saruman is washing away.
Trees will come back to live here, young
trees, wild trees.

STOP

TREEBEARD
Well bless my bark!

GANDALF
Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!
Quickly, now!

STOP

THEODEN
Tonight we remember those who gave their
blood to defend this country. Hail the
victorious dead!

EOWYN
Westu Aragorn hal.

STOP

THEODEN
I am happy for you.
He is an honourable man.

EOWYN
You are both honourable men.

THEODEN
It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our
people to victory.

THEODEN
Don't listen to me - you are young, and
tonight is for you.

MERRY & PIPPIN
Oh, you can search - up and down
As many lands as can be found
But you'll never find a beer so brown
As the one we drink in our home town
You can keep your fancy ales
You can drink them by the flagon
But the only brew, for the brave and true,
Comes from the Green Dragon!

ARAGORN
No news of Frodo?

GANDALF
No word, nothing.

ARAGORN
We still have time.

ARAGORN
Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

GANDALF
Do we know that?

ARAGORN
What does your heart tell you?

GANDALF
That Frodo is alive.

GANDALF
Yes. Yes, he is alive.

STOP

SMEAGOL
Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They
stole it from us. Kill them- kill them-
kill them both!

SMEAGOL
No!

GOLLUM
Shhh! Quiet!

GOLLUM
Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

SMEAGOL
They knows, they knows, they suspects us.
SMEAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER.

GOLLUM
What is it saying, my precious, my love?
Is Smeagol losing his nerve?

SMEAGOL :
No! Not! Never! Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses!
Smeagol wants to see them - dead!

GOLLUM
And we will. Smeagol did it once -
He can do it again.

SMEAGOL
We must get the Precious. We must get it
back.

GOLLUM
Patience, patience, my love. First we must
lead them to her.

SMEAGOL
We lead them to the windy stairs.

GOLLUM
Yes, the stairs. And then?

SMEAGOL
Up, up, up, up the stairs we go, until
we come to - the Tunnel!

GOLLUM
And when they go in, there's no coming out.
She's always hungry, she always needs to
feed. She must eat, all she gets is filthy
Orcses.

SMEAGOL
And they doesn't taste very nice, does
they, Precious?

GOLLUM
No, not very nice at all, my love. She
hungers for sweeter meats.

GOLLUM
"Hobbit meat." And when She throws away the
bones and the empty clothes, then we will
find it.

SMEAGOL
And take it for Me!

GOLLUM
For us-

SMEAGOL
Yes, we, we meant for us.
Gollum! Gollum!

GOLLUM
The Precious will be ours once the
Hobbitses are dead!

SAM
You treacherous little toad!

GOLLUM
No! Not! Help! Master!

FRODO
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

SAM
I heard it from his own mouth he means
to murder us!

SMEAGOL
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly!
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol
and who makes up nasty lies!

SAM
You miserable little maggot! I'll stove
your head in!

FRODO
Sam!

SAM
Call me a liar! You're a liar!

FRODO
Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost.

SAM
I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I
won't wait around for him to kill us!

FRODO
I'm not sending him away.

SAM
You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!

FRODO
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not
without a guide. I need you on my side.

SAM
I'm on your side, Mr Frodo.

FRODO
I know, Sam, I know.
You must trust me.
Come, Smeagol.

STOP

LEGOLAS
The stars are veiled, something stirs in
the east. A sleepless malice.

LEGOLAS
The eye of the enemy is moving.

MERRY
What you doing?
Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?

MERRY
Pippin, are you mad?

PIPPIN
I just want to look at it. Just one more
time.

MERRY
Put it back! Put - it - back!

LEGOLAS
He is here!

MERRY
Help! Someone help him!

STOP

GANDALF
Fool of a Took!

PIPPIN
Gandalf! Forgive me.

GANDALF
Look at me! What did you see?

PIPPIN
A tree. There was a white tree in a
courtyard of stone. It was dead!

PIPPIN
The city was burning.

GANDALF
Minas Tirith?
Is that what you saw?

PIPPIN
I saw- I saw him. I could hear his voice in my head.

GANDALF
And what did you tell him? Speak!

PIPPIN
He asked me my name, I didn't answer. He hurt me-

GANDALF
What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?

STOP

GANDALF
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool,
but an honest fool he remains. He told
Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

GANDALF
We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
enemy's plan.

GANDALF
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
our enemy one thing.

GANDALF
The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
not as weak as he supposed. There is
courage still - strength enough left to
challenge him.

GANDALF
Sauron fears this. He will not risk the
peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one
banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the
ground before he sees the return of the King.

GANDALF
If the beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan
must be ready for war!

THEODEN
Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of
those who did not come to ours?

THEODEN
What do we owe Gondor?

ARAGORN
I will go.

GANDALF
No!

ARAGORN
They must be warned.

GANDALF
They will be.

GANDALF
You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.
Follow the river, look to the black ships.

GANDALF
Understand this: Things are now in
motion that cannot be undone.

GANDALF
I ride for Minas Tirith! And I won't be
going alone!

STOP

GANDALF
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin,
Took, you are the worst. Hurry, hurry!

PIPPIN
Where are we going?

MERRY
Why did you look - why do you always have
to look?

PIPPIN
I don't know, I can't help it.

MERRY
You never can.

PIPPIN
I'm sorry, alright? I won't do it again.

MERRY
Don't you understand! The Enemy thinks
you have the Ring. He's going to be
looking for you, Pip. They have to get you
out of here!

PIPPIN
And you. You're coming with me-
Merry?

MERRY
Come on!

PIPPIN
How far is Minas Tirith?

GANDALF
Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and
you'd better hope we don't have one of
those on our tail.

MERRY
Here - something for the road.

PIPPIN
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

MERRY
I know you've run out. You smoke too
much, Pip.

PIPPIN
But we'll see each other soon?
Won't we?

MERRY
I don't know. I don't know what's going to happen.

GANDALF
Run Shadowfax, show us the meaning of
haste.

PIPPIN
Merry!

STOP

ELROND
Take her by the safest road. A ship lies
anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to
carry her across the Sea. The last
journey of Arwen Undomiel.

ELROND
Arwen, there is nothing for you here. Only death.

ELF ESCORT
Lady Arwen?
We cannot delay.

ELF ESCORT
My Lady!

STOP

ARWEN
What did you see?

ELROND
Arwen?

ARWEN
You have the gift of foresight - tell me
what you have seen.

ELROND
I looked into your future and I saw death.

ARWEN
There is also life.

ARWEN
You saw there was a child. You saw my son.

ELROND
That future is almost gone.

ARWEN
But it is not lost.

ELROND
Nothing is certain.

ARWEN
Some things are certain. If I leave him now
I will regret It forever.
Ada, it is time.

ARWEN
From the ashes of fire shall be woken,
a light from the shadow shall spring,
renewed shall be blade that was broken.
The crownless again shall be King.

ARWEN
Reforge the sword.

ARWEN
Ada.

ELROND
Your hands are cold.
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
It has begun.

ARWEN
This was my choice, Ada. Whether by your
will or not, there is no ship now that can
bear me hence.

STOP

GANDALF
We have just passed into the realm of
Gondor!

GANDALF
Minas Tirith. City of the Kings.

STOP

PIPPIN
It's the tree, Gandalf. Gandalf!

GANDALF
Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of
the King.

GANDALF
Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He
is a steward only. A caretaker of the
throne.

GANDALF
Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
Boromir's father. To give him news of his
beloved son's death would be most unwise.
And do not mention Frodo. Or the Ring.
And say nothing of Aragorn either-
In fact, it's better if you don't speak at
all, Pippin Took.

STOP

GANDALF
Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
Steward of Gondor.

GANDALF
I come with tidings in this dark hour - and
with counsel.

DENETHOR
Perhaps you come to explain this?

DENETHOR
Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is
dead?

PIPPIN
Boromir died to save us. My kinsman and
me. He fell, defending us from many foes.

GANDALF
Pippin!

PIPPIN
I offer you my service, such as it is, in
payment of this debt.

GANDALF
Get up!

GANDALF
My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming.
The Enemy is on your doorstep. As Steward,
you are charged with the defence of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

GANDALF
You still have friends - you are not alone
in this fight. Send word to Theoden of
Rohan. Light the beacons.

DENETHOR
You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for
all your subtleties, you have not wisdom. Do
you think the eyes of the White Tower are
blind? I have seen more than you know. With
your left hand you would use me as a shield
against Mordor and with your right you
would seek to supplant me.

DENETHOR
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,
yes. Word has reached my ears of this
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
North - last of a ragged house, long bereft
of Lordship.

GANDALF
Authority is not given to you to deny the
return of the King - Steward!

DENETHOR
The rule of Gondor is mine, and no others!

GANDALF
Come.

STOP

PIPPIN
So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial
position. I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting, do they?

GANDALF
You're in the service of the Steward now.
You're going to have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took.

GANDALF
Guard of the Citadel!

PIPPIN
It's so quiet.

GANDALF
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

PIPPIN
I don't want to be in a battle, but
waiting on the edge of one I can't escape
is even worse.
Is there any hope, Gandalf - for Frodo and
Sam?

GANDALF
There never was much hope.

GANDALF
Just a fool's hope.

GANDALF
Our enemy is almost ready, his full
strength gathered. Not only Orcs, but men
as well.

GANDALF
Legions of Haradrim from the South.

GANDALF
Mercenaries from the coast. All will
answer Mordor's call.

GANDALF
This will be the end of Gondor as we know
it. Here the hammerstroke will fall
hardest.

GANDALF
If the river is taken, if the garrison at
Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this
city will be gone.

PIPPIN
But we have the White Wizard. That's got to
count for something.

PIPPIN
Gandalf?

GANDALF
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest
servant. The one who will lead Mordor's
armies in war, the one they say no living
man can kill.

GANDALF
The Witchking of Angmar.
You've met him before.
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

GANDALF
He is the Lord of the Nazgul - the greatest
of the Nine.
And Minas Morgul is his lair.

STOP

GOLLUM

The Dead City, very nasty place, full of enemies.

GOLLUM
Quick, quick! They will see, they will see.

GOLLUM
Come away, come away. Look! We have found it.
The way into Mordor!

GOLLUM
The secret stairs - climb!

SAM
No, Mr Frodo!

GOLLUM
Not that way!

GOLLUM
What's it doing?

SAM
No!

FRODO
They're calling me!

STOP

GOLLUM
Hide! Hide!

FRODO
I can feel his blade!

GOLLUM
Come, hobbits. We climb - we must climb!

STOP

GANDALF
We come to it at last, the great battle of our time.
The board is set, the pieces are moving.

GANDALF
This war is long planned. Sauron has hated
the west through many ages. It is a
hatred that flows from the depths of time,
across the deeps of the Sea.

STOP

GANDALF
Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to
be done. Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth!

GANDALF
You must not fail me.

STOP

GOTHMOG
Quiet!

FARAMIR
To the river - quick!

GOTHMOG
Faster!

ORC COMMANDER
Draw swords!

STOP

GANDALF
Amon Din, come on-

SOLDIER
The beacon! The beacon at Amon Din is lit!

GANDALF
Hope is kindled.

STOP

ARAGORN
The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons
are lit! Gondor calls for aid!

THEODEN
Then Rohan will answer. Muster the Rohirrim!

STOP

THEODEN
Assemble the army at Dunharrow - as many
men as can be found. You have two days.
On the third, we ride for Gondor, and war!

THEODEN
Gamling, make haste across the Riddermark
Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow!

STOP

ARAGORN
You ride with us?

EOWYN
Just to the encampment. It's tradition for
the women of the Court to farewell the men.

EOWYN
The Men have found their Captain - they
will follow you into battle, even to death.

STOP

THEODEN
So it is before the walls of Minas
Tirith that the doom of our time will be
decided.

EOMER
Now is the hour! Riders of Rohan - oaths
you have taken. Now, fulfil them all - to
Lord and land!

STOP

MADRIL
We can't hold them. The city is lost!

FARAMIR
Tell the men to break up. We ride for Minas
Tirith.

RANGER
Nazgul!

FARAMIR
Take cover!

FARAMIR
Pull back! Pull back to Minas Tirith!

GOTHMOG
The age of men is over. The time of the Orcs has come.

STOP

IORLAS
Open the Gates! Pull!

FARAMIR
Mithrandir!

FARAMIR
They broke through our defences. They have
taken the bridge a nd the West Bank.
Battalions of Orcs are crossing the River.

IORLAS
It is as the Lord Denethor predicted - long
has he foreseen this doom!

GANDALF
Foreseen and done nothing!

GANDALF
Faramir? This is not the first halfling
to have crossed your path.

FARAMIR
No.

PIPPIN
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

GANDALF
Where? When?

FARAMIR
In Ithilien, not two days ago. Gandalf,
they are taking the road to the Morgul
Vale.

GANDALF
- and then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.

PIPPIN
What does that mean? What's wrong?

GANDALF
Faramir, tell me everything.

STOP

GOLLUM
Careful, Master - careful! Very far to
fall. Very dangerous on the stairs.

GOLLUM
Come, Master.
Come to Smeagol.

SAM
Mr Frodo!
Get back, you. Don't touch him!

GOLLUM
Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has
Smeagol ever done to him? Master?

STOP

GOLLUM
Master carries heavy burden. Smeagol
knows. Heavy, heavy burden. Fat one
cannot know. Smeagol look after Master.

GOLLUM
He wants it - he needs it. Smeagol sees it
in his eye. Very soon he will ask you for
it - you will see. The Fat One will take
it from you.

STOP

WITCH KING
Send forth all legions. Do not stop the
attack until the city is taken. Slay them
all.

GOTHMOG
What of the Wizard?

WITCH KING
I shall break him.

STOP

SOLDIER 1
Where are Theoden's riders?

SOLDIER 2
Will Rohan's army come?

GANDALF
Courage is the best defence that you have
now.

STOP

PIPPIN
Here do I swear fealty and service to
Gondor, in peace or war, in living or
dying, from this hour henceforth, until my
lord release me, or death take me.

DENETHOR
And I shall not forget it, nor fail to
reward that which is given:
Fealty with love.
Valour with honour.
Disloyalty with vengeance.

DENETHOR
I do not think we should so lightly abandon
the outer defences; defences that your
brother long held intact.

FARAMIR
What would you have me do?

DENETHOR
I will not yield the River and Pelennor
unfought. Osgiliath must be retaken.

FARAMIR
My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

DENETHOR
Much must be risked in war. Is there a
Captain here who still has the courage to
do his Lord's will?

FARAMIR
You wish now that our places had been
exchanged, that I had died and Boromir had
lived?

DENETHOR
Yes, I wish that.

FARAMIR
Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do
what I can in his stead.

FARAMIR
If I should return, think better of me, father.

DENETHOR
That will depend on the manner of your
return.

STOP

SAM
What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?

SMEAGOL
Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so
polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that
nobody else could find and they say
"Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh
yes, my Precious, very nice.

SAM
Alright, alright - you just startled me is all.
What were you doing?

SMEAGOL
Sneaking!

SAM
Fine, have it your own way.

STOP

SAM
Sorry to wake you, Mr Frodo. We have to be
moving on.

FRODO
It's dark still.

SAM
It's always dark here-
It's gone! The Elven bread!

FRODO
What? That's all we have left!

SAM
He took it! He must have!

GOLLUM
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread!

SAM
You're a lying wretch!
What did you do with it?

FRODO
He doesn't eat it. He can't have taken it.

GOLLUM
What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses!
He took it! He took it! I seen him, he's
always stuffing himself when Master's not
looking!

SAM
That's a filthy lie!

SAM
You stinking two-faced sneak! Call me a
thief!

FRODO
Sam! Stop it!

SAM
I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

FRODO
No, Sam!

SAM
Alight, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to
go so far, I was so angry. Here, let's
rest up a bit.

FRODO
I'm alright.

SAM
No, no, you're not alright! You're
exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this
place; it's that thing around your neck.
I could help a bit. I could carry it for
a while - share the load.

FRODO
Get away!

SAM
I don't want to keep it. I just want to help!

GOLLUM
See! See! He wants it for himself.

SAM
Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of here.

FRODO
No, Sam, it's you.

FRODO
I'm sorry, Sam.

SAM
But he's a liar! He's poisoned you against me.

FRODO
You can't help me anymore.

SAM
You don't mean that.

FRODO
Go home.

STOP

GANDALF
Faramir! Your father's will has turned to
madness! Do not throw away your life so
rashly!

FARAMIR
Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

GANDALF
Your father loves you, Faramir!
And will remember it before the end.

STOP

DENETHOR
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

PIPPIN
Well yes, at least, well enough for my
own people. But we have no songs for
great halls and evil times. We seldom
sing of anything more terrible than wind or
rain.

DENETHOR
And why should your songs be unfit for my
halls, or for hours such as these. Come -
sing me a song!

PIPPIN
Home is behind, the world ahead,
And there are many paths to tread.
Through shadow to the edge of night
Until the stars are all alight.
Mist and shadow, cloud and shade:
All shall fade, all shall fade.

STOP

THEODEN
Grimbold, how many?

GRIMBOLD
I bring five hundred men from the Westfold,
my Lord.

ROHAN MARSHALL
We have three hundred more from Fenmarch,
Theoden, King.

DENETHOR
Where are the riders from Snowbourne?

GAMLING
None have come, My Lord.

THEODEN
Six thousand spears. Less than half of what I had hoped for.

ARAGORN
Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.

THEODEN
More will come.

ARAGORN
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat. We
have till dawn. Then we must ride.

STOP

LEGOLAS
The horses are restless. And the men are quiet.

EOMER
They grow nervous in the shadow of the
mountain.

GIMLI
That road there - where does that lead?

LEGOLAS
It is the road to the Dimholt. The door
under the mountain.

EOMER
None who venture there ever return.
That mountain is evil.

GIMLI
Aragorn!
Let's find some food.

STOP

EOWYN
There! A true Esquire of Rohan.

MERRY
Sorry! It isn't all that dangerous.
It isn't even sharp.

EOWYN
Well, that's no good. You won't kill many
Orcs with a blunt blade. Come on.

EOWYN
To the Smith. Go!

EOMER
You should not encourage him.

EOWYN
And you should not doubt him.

EOMER
I do not doubt his heart, only the reach
of his arm.

EOWYN
Why should Merry be left behind? He has as
much cause to go to war as you.
Why can he not fight for those he loves?

STOP

GANDALF
Look to the Black Ships-

ARWEN
I choose a mortal life. I wish I could
have seen him, one last time.

GUARD
King Theoden awaits you, my Lord.

STOP

THEODEN
I take my leave.

ARAGORN
My Lord, Elrond.

ELROND
I come on behalf of one whom I love.
Arwen is dying.

ARAGORN
She stayed?

ELROND
She will not long survive the evil that now
spreads from Mordor.

ELROND
The light of the Evenstar is failing. As
Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the
end has come.

ARAGORN
It will not be our end, but his.

ELROND
You ride to war, but not to victory.
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -
this you know - but in secret he sends
another force which will attack from the
river.

ELROND
A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the
South. They will be in the city in two days.
You're out-numbered, Aragorn. You need more
men.

ARAGORN
There are none.

ELROND
There are those who dwell in the mountain.

ARAGORN
Murderers, traitors - you would call upon
them to fight? They believe in nothing.
They answer to no-one.

ELROND
They will answer to the King of Gondor.
Anduril, flame of the West. Forged from
the shards of Narsil.

ARAGORN
Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of
Elendil. The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

ELROND
The man who can wield the power of this
sword can summon to him an army more deadly
than any that walks this earth.

ELROND
Put aside the Ranger - become who you were
born to be - take the Dimholt Road.

ELROND
Onen i-estel Edain. U-chebin estel anim.
(I gave Hope to the Dúnedain. I keep none for myself.)

STOP

EOWYN
Why are you doing this?

EOWYN
The war lies to the East. You cannot leave
on the eve of battle. You cannot abandon the men.

ARAGORN
Eowyn-

EOWYN
We need you here-

ARAGORN
Why have you come?

EOWYN
Do you not know?

ARAGORN
It is but a shadow and a thought that you
love. I cannot give you what you seek.

STOP

GIMLI
And just where do you think you're off to?

ARAGORN
Not this time. This time you must stay, my friend.

LEGOLAS
Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness
of Dwarves?

GIMLI
You might as well accept it - we're going
with you, laddie.

STOP

GAMLING
Lord Aragorn!

ROHAN SOLDIER
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

GAMLING
He leaves because there is no hope.

THEODEN
He leaves because he must.

GAMLING
Too few have come. We cannot defeat the
armies of Mordor.

THEODEN
No, we cannot. But we will meet
them in battle, nonetheless.

STOP

THEODEN
I have left instruction: the people are to
follow your rule in my stead. Take up my
seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you
defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.

EOWYN
What other duty would you have me do, my
Lord?

THEODEN
Duty? No, I would have you smile again -
not grieve for those whose time has come.

THEODEN
You shall live to see these days renewed.

THEODEN
No more despair.

STOP

GIMLI
What kind of an army would linger in such a
place?

LEGOLAS
One that is cursed. Long ago the Men of
the Mountain swore an oath to the last King
of Gondor, to come to his aid, to fight.
But when the time came, when Gondor's need
was dire, they fled, Vanishing into the
darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur
cursed them - never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

STOP

GIMLI
The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.

LEGOLAS
The way is shut. It was made by those who
are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is
shut.

ARAGORN
I do not fear death.

GIMLI
Well, this is a thing unheard of! An Elf
will go underground when a Dwarf dare not.
Oh! I'd never hear the end of it!

STOP

THEODEN
We must ride light and swift. It's a long
road ahead, and man and beast must reach
the end with the strength to fight.

THEODEN
Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master
Meriadoc!

MERRY
All my friends have gone to battle. I would
be ashamed to be left behind!

THEODEN
It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith.
None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.

MERRY
But I want to fight!

THEODEN
I will say no more.

STOP

EOWYN
Ride with me.

MERRY
My Lady!

EOMER
Move out - move out!

THEODEN
Ride! Ride now, for Gondor!

STOP

KING OF THE DEAD
Who enters my domain?

ARAGORN
One who will have your allegiance.

KING OF THE DEAD
The dead do not suffer the living to pass.

ARAGORN
You will suffer me!

KING OF THE DEAD
The way is shut.
It was made by those who are Dead
and the Dead keep it.

KING OF THE DEAD
The way is shut. Now, you must die.

ARAGORN
I summon you to fulfil your oath!

KING OF THE DEAD
None but the King of Gondor may command me!

KING OF THE DEAD
It cannot be - that blade was broken!

ARAGORN
It has been remade!

ARAGORN
Fight for us and regain your honour!

ARAGORN
What say you?

GIMLI
Your wasting your time, Aragorn. They
had no honour in life, they have none now
in death.

ARAGORN
I am Isildur's heir. Fight for me and I
will hold your oath fulfilled. What say
you?

STOP

GATE GUARD
Open the gate! Quick!

DENETHOR
Faramir!
Say not that he has fallen.

IORLAS
They were outnumbered, none survived.

STOP

GOTHMOG
Fear! The city is rank with it. Let us ease
their pain. Release the prisoners!

LIEUTENANT
Catapults!

DENETHOR
My son is dead. My line is ended.

PIPPIN
He's alive!

DENETHOR
The House of Stewards has failed!

PIPPIN
He needs medicine, my Lord!

DENETHOR
My line has ended!

PIPPIN
My Lord!

DENETHOR
Rohan has deserted us!
Theoden's betrayed me!

DENETHOR
Abandon your posts!
Flee! Flee for your lives!

GANDALF
Prepare for battle!
Return to your posts!

STOP

GANDALF
Send these foul beasts into the abyss!

GOTHMOG
Stay where you are!

GANDALF
Stand to your posts! Do not give in to
fear. Fight!

GANDALF
Not at the towers! Aim for the trolls! Kill
the trolls! Bring them down!

GANDALF
Peregrin Took! Go back to the citadel!

PIPPIN
They called us out to fight-

GANDALF
This is no place for a Hobbit!

GANDALF
Guard of the Citadel, indeed! Now, back up
the hill - quickly! Quickly!

ORCS
Grond! Grond! Grond!

STOP

FRODO
What is this place?

GOLLUM
Master must go inside the tunnel.

FRODO
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

SMEAGOL
It's the only way.
Go in - or go back.

FRODO
I can't go back.

FRODO
What's that smell?

GOLLUM
Orcses filth! Orcses come in here
sometimes.

GOLLUM.
Hurry!

GOLLUM
This way.

FRODO
Smeagol!

GOLLUM
Over here.

STOP

FRODO
It's sticky! What is it?

GOLLUM
You will see. Oh yes, you will see.

STOP

GALADRIEL
I give you the light of Earendil - our most
beloved star. May it be a light for you in
dark places when all other lights go out.

FRODO
Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!

STOP

GOLLUM
Naughty little fly,
Why does it cry?
Caught in a web
Soon you'll be- eaten!

GOLLUM
Got away did it, Precious? Not this time,
not this time!

STOP

SMEAGOL
It wasn't us! It wasn't us! Smeagol
wouldn't hurt Master.

SMEAGOL
Smeagol promised. You must believe us. It
was the Precious - the Precious made us to
do it.

FRODO
I have to destroy it, Smeagol. I have to
destroy it for both our sakes.

STOP

FRODO
I'm so sorry, Sam.
So sorry-

GALADRIEL
This task was appointed to you, Frodo of
the Shire. If you do not find a way, no-
one will.

STOP

GANDALF
To the Gates! Man the Gates!

STOP

DENETHOR
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long
slow sleep of death embalmed. We shall
burn - like the heathen kings of old!

DENETHOR
Bring wood and oil!

STOP

GANDALF
Steady! Steady!
You are soldiers of Gondor! No matter what
comes through that gate you will stand your
ground!

GANDALF
Fire!

STOP

SAM
Let him go, you filth!

SAM
You will not touch him again!
Come on and finish it!

STOP

SAM
Mr Frodo!
Oh no! Frodo!

SAM
Mr Frodo! Wake up!

SAM
Wake up! Don't leave me here alone.
Don't go where I can't follow. Wake up!

SAM
Not asleep - dead.

STOP

GORBAG
What's this? Looks like Old Shelob's been
having a bit of fun!

SHAGRAT
Killed another one, has she?

GORBAG
No, this fellow ain't dead.

SAM
Not dead!

GORBAG
She jabs them with her stinger and they go
as limp as a boned fish. Then she has her
way with them. That's how she likes to feed
- fresh blood.
Get him to the Tower!

SAM
Samwise, you fool!

ORC 2
This fellow will be awake in a few hours.

GORBAG
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

STOP

DENETHOR
The house of his spirit crumbles! He is
burning, already burning.

PIPPIN
He's not dead! He's not dead!

PIPPIN
No no no! He's not dead. No!

DENETHOR
Farewell Peregrin, son of Paladin.
I release you from my service.

DENETHOR throws PIPPIN outside!

DENETHOR
Go now and die in what way seems best to you.

DENETHOR
Pour oil on the wood!

Gandalf? Gandalf?

GANDALF
Pull back - to the second level! Hurry! Get

Fight! Fight for your lives!

Grimbold, take your company right after we pass the wall!
Forth and fear no darkness!

Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden!
Spears shall be shaken! Shields shall be splintered!
A sword day, a red day, ere the sun rises!

Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.

Ride now, ride now!
Ride, ride for ruin and the world's ending!
Death!

Death! Forth Eorlingas!

No, do not take my son from me!

Make safe the city!

Reform the line - reform the line!

THEODEN
Sound the charge!

STOP

PIPPIN
I didn't think it would end this way.

GANDALF
End? No, the journey doesn't end here.
Death is just another path, one that we all
must take. The grey rain curtain of this world rolls
back and all turns to silver glass.
And then you see it-

PIPPIN
What, Gandalf? See what?

GANDALF
White shores. And beyond, a far green
country under a swift sunrise.

PIPPIN
Well, that isn't so bad.

GANDALF
No. No, it isn't.

STOP

THEODEN
Rally to me! To me!

STOP

WITCH-KING
Feast on his flesh!

No man can kill me. Die!

EOWYN
I am no man!

Late as usual! Get off your ships, you sea
rats! There's knife work here needs doing.

Plenty for the both of us! May the best dwarf win!

STOP

GIMLI
That still only counts as one!

STOP

THEODEN
I know your face. Eowyn!

THEODEN
My eyes darken.

EOWYN
Nom I am going to save you.

THEODEN
You already did.
My body is broken. You have to let me go.

EOWYN
No!

THEODEN
I go to my fathers, in whose mighty
company, I shall not now feel ashamed.

STOP

KING OF THE DEAD
Release us.

GIMLI
Bad idea. Very handy in a tight spot, these
lads - despite the fact, they're dead!

KING OF THE DEAD
You gave us your word.

ARAGORN
I hold your oath fulfilled. Go. Be at peace.

STOP

PIPPIN
Merry? Merry, it's me, it's Pippin!

MERRY
I knew you'd find me.
Are you going to leave me?

No Merry, I'm going to look after you.

STOP

SHAGRAT
Hey! Hands off - that shiny shirt, that's
mine.

GORBAG
It's going to the Great Eye, along with
everything else!

SHAGRAT
I don't take orders from stinking Morgul
rats!

GORBAG
You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in
your guts!

SHAGRAT
The scum tried to knife me! Kill him!

STOP

SAM
That's for Frodo!
And for the Shire!
And that's for my old Gaffer!

GORBAG
Stop your squeaking you dunghill rat!

GORBAG
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig!

SAM
Not if I stick you first!

FRODO
Sam! Oh, Sam.
I'm so sorry - sorry for everything.

SAM
Come on.

FRODO
It's too late. It's over. They've taken
it, Sam. They took the Ring!

SAM
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.
I thought I'd lost you, so I took it.
Only for safe-keeping.

FRODO
Give it to me.
Give me the Ring, Sam.

FRODO
Sam! Give me the Ring.

FRODO
You must understand. The Ring is my
burden. It will destroy you, Sam.

SAM
Come on, Mr Frodo, we'd best find you some
clothes. You can't go walking through
Mordor in naught but your skin.

STOP

SAM
We did it, Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor.

FRODO
There are so many of them. So many.
We'll never get through unseen.

FRODO
It's him - the Eye.

SAM
We have to go in there, Mr Frodo. There's
nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

STOP

GANDALF
Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The
darkness is deepening.

ARAGORN
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

GANDALF
It's only a matter of time. He has suffered
a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of
Mordor our enemy is regrouping.

GIMLI
Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should
we care?

GANDALF
Because ten thousand Orcs now stand between
Frodo and Mount Doom.

GANDALF
I have sent him to his death.

ARAGORN
No, there is still hope for Frodo. He needs
time and safe passage across the Plains of
Gorgoroth. We can give him that.

GANDALF
How?

ARAGORN
Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands.
Then we gather our full strength and march
on the Black Gate.

EOMER
We cannot achieve victory from strength of
arms.

ARAGORN
Not for ourselves. But we can give Frodo
his chance if we keep Sauron's eye fixed
upon us. Keep him blind to all else that
moves.

LEGOLAS
A diversion-

GANDALF
Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not
take the bait!

GIMLI
Certainty of death. Small chance of
success. What are we waiting for?

STOP

SAM
Look, the Orcs! They're moving off. You
see, Mr Frodo - some luck at last.

SAM
Take mine. There's a few drops left.

FRODO
There'll be none left for the return
journey.

SAM
I don't think there will be a return
journey, Mr Frodo.

STOP

ARAGORN
Let the lord of the Black Land come forth;
let justice be done upon him.

MOUTH OF SAURON
My master Sauron the Great bids thee welcome.

MOUTH OF SAURON
Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me?

GANDALF
We do not come to treat with Sauron, faithless and accursed.
Tell your master this. The armies of Mordor must disband.
He is to depart these lands, never to return.

MOUTH OF SAURON
Aha! Old Greybeard!
I have a token I was bidden to show thee.

MERRY & PIPPIN
Frodo, no!

GANDALF
Silence!

MOUTH OF SAURON
The Halfling was dear to thee I see.
Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.
Who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain?
And he did Gandalf, he did.

MOUTH OF SAURON
And who is this? Isildur's heir?
It takes more to make a King than a broken Elvish blade.

GIMLI
I guess that concludes negotiations.

ARAGORN
I do not believe it. I will not!

STOP

ARAGORN
Pull back! Pull back!

STOP

SAM
It's gone, Mr Frodo.

SAM
The light's passed on, away towards the
North! Something's drawn it's gaze.

STOP

ARAGORN
Hold your ground - hold your ground!
Sons of Gondor - of Rohan. My brothers!

ARAGORN
I see in your eyes the same fear that would
take the heart of me. The day may come when
the courage of Men fails; when we forsake
our friends and break all bonds of
fellowship; but it is not this day!
An hour of wolves and shattered shields, when
the Age of Man comes crashing down - but it
is not this day! This day we fight! By
all that you hold dear on this good earth -
I bid you stand!
Men of the West!

ARAGORN
For Frodo.

STOP

GIMLI
Never thought I'd die fighting side by side
with an Elf.

LEGOLAS
What about side by side with a friend?

GIMLI
Aye, I could do that.

STOP

SAM
Do you remember the Shire, Mr Frodo?
It'll be spring soon, and the orchards
will be in blossom; and the birds will be
nesting in the hazel thicket; and they'11
be sowing the summer barley in the lower
fields; and eating the first of the
strawberries with cream.
Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

FRODO
No, Sam. I can't recall the taste of food;
nor the sound of water; nor the touch of
grass. I'm naked in the dark.
There's no veil between me and the wheel of
fire. I can see it with my waking eyes.

SAM
Then let us be rid of it - once and for
all! Come on, Mr Frodo. I can't carry it
for you - but I can carry you! Come on!

STOP

SAM
Look, Mr Frodo! We're almost there!

GOLLUM
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

STOP

PIPPIN
Eagles - The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming!

STOP

SAM
Frodo!

FRODO
I'm here, Sam.

SAM
Destroy it - go on! Throw it in the fire!

SAM
What are you waiting for? Just let it go!

FRODO
The Ring is mine.

SAM
No!

STOP

GOLLUM
Yes! YES!
Precious! Precious!

STOP

SAM
Give me your hand.
Take my hand!

SAM
No! Don't you let go! Don't let go. Reach!

STOP

FRODO
It's gone. It's done.

SAM
Yes, Mr Frodo. It's over now.

FRODO
I can see the Shire. The Brandywine
River, Bag End, Gandalf's fireworks, the
lights in the Party Tree.

SAM
Rosie Cotton dancing. She had ribbons in
her hair. If ever I was to marry someone, it
would have been her. It would have been
her.

FRODO
I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee.
here at the end of all things.

STOP

GANDALF
Now come the days of the King.
May they be blessed.

ARAGORN
This day does not belong to one man but to
all. Let us together rebuild this world
that we may share in the days of peace.

ARAGORN
My friends. You bow to no-one.

STOP

FRODO
And thus it was a Fourth Age of Middle-
earth began, and the Fellowship of the
Ring, though eternally bound by friendship
and love, was ended.
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey,
we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight:
We were home!

FRODO
How do you pick up the threads of an old
life? How do you go on, when in your heart
you begin to understand. There is no going
back. There are some things that time
cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep.
That have taken hold.

SAM
Mr Frodo?

SAM
What is it?

FRODO
It's been four years to the day since
Weathertop, Sam. It's never really healed.

SAM
"There and Back Again. A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.
And The Lord of the Rings, by Frodo Baggins".
You've finished it!

FRODO
Not quite. There's room for a little more.

FRODO
Bilbo once told me, the great stories never
end - that each of us must come and go in
the telling. His part in this tale was now
over. There would be no more journeys for
Bilbo. Save one.

STOP

BILBO
Tell me again, lad. Where are we going?

FRODO
To the harbour, Bilbo. The Elves have
accorded you a special honour. A place on
the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

BILBO
Frodo, any chance of seeing that old
ring of mine? The one I gave you?

FRODO
Sorry, Uncle. I'm afraid, I lost it.

BILBO
Oh, pity. I should like to have held it
one last time.

BILBO
Oh! Well, here's a sight I have never·seen
before.

STOP

GALADRIEL
The power of the Three Rings is ended. The
time has come for the Dominion of Men.

ELROND
I Aear can ven na mar.
(The Sea calls us home.)

BILBO
I think I'm quite ready for another
adventure.

GANDALF
Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now
finished. Here at last, on the shores of
the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship.

GANDALF
I will not say: "do not weep", for not all
tears are an evil.

GANDALF
It is time, Frodo.

SAM
What does he mean?

FRODO
We set out to save the Shire, and it has
been saved. But not for me.

SAM
You don't mean that - you can't leave.

FRODO
The last pages are for you, Sam.

STOP

SAM
Elanor!

FRODO
My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in
two. You have to be one and whole for many
years. You have so much enjoy and to be and
to do. Because Sam, your part in the
journey goes on.

SAM
Hello, little Frodo!

SAM
Well, I'm back.

HARDSTOP

OLD BILBO
My dear Frodo, you asked me once if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures.
And while I can honestly say I have told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it.
I am old now Frodo. I'm not the same hobbit I once was. I think it is time for you to know what really happened.

OLD BILBO
It began long ago in a land far away to the East. The like of which you will not find in the world today.

OLD BILBO
There was the city of Dale. Its markets known far and wide, full of the bounties of vine and vale,
peaceful and prosperous. For this city lay before the doors of the greatest kingdom in Middle-Earth, Erebor.
Stronghold of Thror, king under the mountain. The mightiest of the dwarf lords. Thror ruled with utter surety,
never doubting his house would endure, for his line lay secure in the lives of his son and grandson.

OLD BILBO
Ah, Frodo. Erebor. Built deep within the mountain itself, the beauty of this fortress city was legend.
Its wealth lay in the earth, in precious gems hewn from rock, and in great seams of gold running like rivers through stone.
The skill of the dwarves was unequaled. Fashioning objects of great beauty, out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire.

OLD BILBO
Ever they delved deeper down into the dark, and that is where they found it. The heart of the mountain, the Arkenstone.
Thror named it the king's jewel. He took it as a sign, a sign that his right to rule was divine.

OLD BILBO
All would pay homage to him. Even the great Elven king, Thranduil. But the years of peace and plenty were not to last.
Slowly the days turned sour, and the watchful nights closed in.

OLD BILBO
Thror's love of gold had grown too fierce. A sickness had begun to grow within him.
It was a sickness of the mind. And where sickness thrives bad things will follow.

OLD BILBO
The first they heard was a noise like a hurricane, coming down from the North.
The pines on the mountain creaked and cracked in the hot dry wind.

THORIN
Balin, sound the alarm. Call out the guards, do it now!

BALIN
What is it?

THORIN
Dragon. Dragon!

OLD BILBO
He was a Firedrake from the North.

OLD BILBO
Smaug had come!

OLD BILBO
Such wanton death was dealt that day, for this city of men was nothing to Smaug.
His eye was set on another prize. For dragons covet gold with a dark and fierce desire.

THROR
No!

OLD BILBO
Erebor was lost. For a dragon will guard his plunder as long as he lives.

THORIN
Run for your lives!

THORIN
Help us!

OLD BILBO
Thranduil would not risk the lives of his kin against the wrath of the dragon.
No help came from the Elves that day. Nor any day since.

OLD BILBO
Robbed of their homeland, the dwarves of Erebor wandered the wilderness.
The once mighty people brought low. The young dwarf prince took work where he could find it,
laboring in the villages of men. But always, he remembered the mountain smoke beneath the moon,
the trees like torches blazing bright, where he had seen dragon fire in the sky, and a city turn to ash.
And he never forgave, and he never forgot.

STOP

OLD BILBO
That, my dear Frodo, is where I come in. For quite by chance, and the will of a wizard,
fate decided I would become part of this tale. It began as you might expect.

OLD BILBO
In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty wet hole full of worms and oozy smells.
This was a hobbit hole. And that means good food, a warm hearth, and all the comforts of home.

STOP

OLD BILBO
Thank you.

FRODO
What's this?

OLD BILBO
That is private. Keep your sticky paws off!

OLD BILBO
It's not ready yet.

FRODO
Not ready for what?

OLD BILBO
Reading.

OLD BILBO
What on earth are these?

FRODO
Replies to the party invitations.

OLD BILBO
Ah! Good gracious! Is it today?

FRODO
They all say they're coming, except for the Sackville-Bagginses, who are demanding you ask them in person.

OLD BILBO
Are they, indeed. Over my dead body.

FRODO
They'd probably find that quite agreeable. They seem to think you have tunnels overflowing with gold.

OLD BILBO
It was one small chest, hardly overflowing. And it still smells of troll.

FRODO
What on earth are you doing?

OLD BILBO
Taking precautions. You know I caught her making off with the silverware once.

FRODO
Who?

OLD BILBO
Lobelia Sackville-Baggins. She had all my spoons stuffed in her pockets. Dreadful woman.
Make sure you keep an eye on her after I'm-

FRODO
When you're what?

OLD BILBO
It's nothing. Nothing.

FRODO
You know, some people are beginning to wonder about you, uncle.
They think you're becoming odd.

OLD BILBO
Odd?

FRODO
Well, unsociable.

OLD BILBO
Unsociable, me? Nonsense. Be a good lad and put that on the gate.

FRODO
Do you think he'll come?

OLD BILBO
Who?

FRODO
Gandalf.

OLD BILBO
Oh, he wouldn't miss a chance to let off his whiz poppers. He'll give us quite a show, you'll see.

FRODO
Right then. I am off.

OLD BILBO
Off to where?

FRODO
Eastfarthing woods. I'm going to surprise him.

OLD BILBO
Well, go on then. You don't want to be late.

OLD BILBO
He doesn't approve being late. Not that I ever was. In those days, I was always on time.
I was entirely respectable, and nothing unexpected- ever happened.

STOP

BILBO
Good morning.

GANDALF
What do you mean? Do you mean to wish me a good morning,
or do you mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not?
Or perhaps you mean to say that you feel good on this particular morning?
Or are you simply stating that this is a morning to be good on?

BILBO
All of them at once, I suppose.

BILBO
Can I help you?

GANDALF
It remains to be seen. I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure.

BILBO
An adventure? No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree, would have much interest in adventures.
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things. Make you late for dinner!

BILBO
Good morning!

GANDALF
To think that I should have lived to be good-morninged by Belladonna Took's son,
as if I was selling buttons at the door!

BILBO
Beg your pardon?

GANDALF
You've changed, and not entirely for the better, Bilbo Baggins.

BILBO
I'm sorry, do I know you?

GANDALF
Well you know my name, although you don't remember I belong to it.
I'm Gandalf, and Gandalf means me!

BILBO
Gandalf? Not Gandalf, the wandering wizard who made such excellent fireworks?
Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve! Well! I had no idea you were still in business.

GANDALF
And where else should I be?

BILBO
Well-

GANDALF
Well, I'm pleased to find you remember something about me, even if it's only my fireworks.

GANDALF
Well that's decided. It'll be very good for you, and most amusing for me. I shall inform the others.

BILBO
Inform the who? What? No! No! No, wait.

BILBO
We do not want any adventures here, thank you!
I suggest you try over the hill or across the water. Good morning.

STOP

DWALIN
Dwalin.

DWALIN
At your service.

BILBO
Hm. Bilbo Baggins at yours.

BILBO
Do we know each other?

DWALIN
No. Which way, laddie? Is it down here?

BILBO
Is- is what down where?

DWALIN
Supper.

DWALIN
He said there'd be food, and lots of it.

BILBO
He- he said? Who said?

DWALIN
Very good this. Any more?

BILBO
What? Oh- yes, yes.

BILBO
Help yourself.

BILBO
Hmm. It's just that, I wasn't expecting company.

DWALIN
That'll be the door.

BALIN
Balin. At your service.

BILBO
Good evening.

BALIN
Yes. Yes, it is. Although I think it might rain later.

BALIN
Am I late?

BILBO
Late for what?

BALIN
Ooh! Ah-hah! Evening, brother!

DWALIN
By my beard! You are shorter and wider than last we met.

BALIN
Wider, not shorter. Sharp enough for both of us.

BILBO
Excuse me. Sorry. I hate to interrupt. But the thing is I'm not entirely sure you're in the right house.

BALIN
Have you eaten?

BILBO
It's not that I don't like visitors. I like visitors as much as the next Hobbit. But I do like to know them before they come visiting.

DWALIN
What is this?

BALIN
I don't know. I think it's supposed to be cheese, it's gone blue.

BILBO
The thing is, um-

DWALIN
It's riddled with mold.

BILBO
The thing is, I don't know either of you, not in the slightest. I don't mean to be blunt, but I had to speak my mind. I'm sorry.

BALIN
Apology accepted.

BILBO
Well-

BALIN
Oh, no. Fill it up now, brother, don't stint.

DWALIN
You want to get stuck in?

BALIN
I could eat again if you insist, brother.

FILI
Fili.

KILI
And Kili.

FILI & KILI
At your service.

KILI
You must be Mister Baggins.

BILBO
No! You can't come in, you've come to the wrong house.

KILI
What? Has it been canceled?

FILI
No one told us.

BILBO
Can-? No, nothing's been canceled.

KILI
That's a relief.

FILI
Careful with these, I just had them sharpened.

KILI
It's nice, this place. Did you do it yourself?

BILBO
No, it's been in the family for years.

BILBO
That's my mother's glory box, can you please not do that?

DWALIN
Fili, Ki­li, come on, give us a hand.

KILI
Mister Dwalin.

BALIN
Let's shove this in the hole, or otherwise we'll never get everyone in.

BILBO
Ev- everyone? How many more are there?

BILBO
Oh, no! No, no. There's nobody home! Go away, and bother somebody else!
There's far too many dwarves in my dining room as it is. If this is some blockhead's idea of a joke,
I can only say, it is in very poor taste!

BILBO
Gandalf.

STOP

BILBO
Those are my-! Excuse me, not my wine! Put that back. Put that back! Not the jam, please. Excuse me.

BILBO
Ex- Excuse me. A tad excessive, isn't it? Have you got a cheese knife?

BOFUR
A cheese knife? He eats it by the block.

BILBO
No no, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair, no-, so is that. Take it back, please.
Take it back, this is antique, not for sitting on. Thank you. That is a book, not a coaster. Uh- put that map down.

DORI
Excuse me, Mister Gandalf.

GANDALF
Yes?

DORI
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile?

GANDALF
Ooh, no thank you, Dori. A little red wine, for me I think.

GANDALF
Fili, Kili. Oin, Gloin. Dwalin, Balin. Bifur, Bofur, Bombur. Dori, Nori.

BILBO
No, no. Not my prize winners, thank you.

GANDALF
Ori!

GANDALF
Yes, you are quite right, Bifur. We appear to be one dwarf short.

DWALIN
He is late, is all. He traveled north to a meeting of our kin, he will come.

DORI
Mister Gandalf?

GANDALF
Hmm?

DORI
A little glass of red wine as requested, it's got a fruity bouquet.

GANDALF
Oh, cheers.

FILI
Who wants an ale? There you go.

OIN
Let me have another drink.

BALIN
Here you go.

BOFUR
Hey, on the count of three! One! Two! Come!

BILBO
Ex- excuse me, that is a doily, not a dish cloth.

BOFUR
But it's full of holes!

BILBO
It's supposed to look like that, it's crochet.

BOFUR
Oh, and a wonderful game it is too, if you got the balls for it.

BILBO
Bebother and confusticate these dwarves!

GANDALF
My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the matter?

BILBO
What's the matter? I am surrounded by dwarves. What they're doing here?

GANDALF
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering, once you get used to them.

BILBO
I don't want to get used to them. Look at the state of my kitchen!
There's mud trod in the carpet, they've pillaged the pantry!
I'm not even gonna tell you what they've done in the bathroom, they've all but destroyed the plumbing!
I don't understand what they're doing in my house!

ORI
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt. But what should do with my plate?

FILI
Here you go, Ori, give it to me.

BILBO
Excuse me! That's my mother's Westfarthing pottery, it's over a hundred years old!

BILBO
And, can you not do that, you'll blunt them!

BOFUR
Ooh, d'you hear that, lads? He says we'll blunt the knives!

KILI
Blunt the knives, bend the forks.

FILI
Smash the bottles and burn the corks.

DWARVES
Chip the glasses and crack the plates. That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!
Cut the cloth and tread on the fat. Leave the bones on the bedroom-mat,
pour the milk on the pantry-floor, splash the wine on every door, dump the crocks in a boiling bowl,
pound them up with a thumping pole. When you've finished, if any are whole, send them down the hall to roll!

DWARVES
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!

GANDALF
He's here.

THORIN
Gandalf. I thought you said this place would be easy to find. I lost my way, twice.

BALIN
What news from the meeting in Ered Luin? Did they all come?

THORIN
Aye, envoys from all seven kingdoms.

DWALIN
And what did the dwarves of the Iron Hill say? Is Dain with us?

THORIN
They will not come.

THORIN
They say this quest is ours, and ours alone.

BILBO
You're doing a quest?

GANDALF
Bilbo, my dear fellow, let us have a little more light.

GANDALF
Far to the East, over ranges and rivers, beyond woodlands and wastelands, lies a single solitary peak.

BILBO
The Lonely Mountain.

GLOIN
Aye, Oin has read the portents, and the portents say
it is time.

OIN
Ravens have been seen flying back to the mountain as it was foretold.
When the birds of the old return to Erebor, the reign of the beast will end.

BILBO
What beast?

BOFUR
Well that would be a reference to Smaug the Terrible, chiefest and greatest calamity of our age.
Airborne fire breather, teeth like razors, claws like meat hooks, extremely fond of precious metals.

BILBO
Yes, I know what a dragon is.

ORI
I'm not afraid, I'm up for it. I'll give him a taste of the dwarfish iron right up his jacksy!

DORI
Sit down!

BALIN
The task would be difficult enough with an army behind us, but we number just thirteen, and not thirteen of the best, nor brightest.

ORI
Hey! Who are you calling dim?

FILI
We may be few in number. But we're fighters, all of us! To the last dwarf!

KILI
And you forget we have a wizard in our company, Gandalf will have killed hundreds of dragons in his time.

GANDALF
Oh, well. No, uh, I wouldn't say-

DORI
How many then?

GANDALF
What?

DORI
Well, how many dragons have you killed? Go on, give us a number!

BILBO
Please. Please.

THORIN
Enough!

THORIN
If we have read these signs, do you not think others will have read them too? Rumors have begun to spread.
The dragon Smaug has not been seen for sixty years. Eyes look East to the mountain, assessing, wondering,
weighing the risk. Perhaps the vast wealth of our people now lies unprotected.
Do we sit back while others claim what is rightfully ours? Or do we seize this chance to take back Erebor?

BALIN
You forget the front gate is sealed. There is no way into the mountain.

GANDALF
That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.

THORIN
How came you by this?

GANDALF
It was given to me by your father by Thrain, for safekeeping. It is yours now.

FILI
If there is a key, there must be a door!

GANDALF
These runes speak of a hidden passage to the lower halls.

KILI
There's another way in.

GANDALF
Well, if we can find it, but dwarf doors are invisible when closed. The answer lies hidden somewhere in this map,
and I do not have the skill to find it, but there are others in Middle-Earth who can.
The task I have in mind will require a great deal of stealth, and no small amount of courage.
But if we're careful and clever, I believe that it can be done.

ORI
That's why we need a burglar.

BILBO
Hmm. And a good one too. An expert, I'd imagine.

GLOIN
And are you?

BILBO
Am I what?

OIN
He said he's an expert!

BILBO
Me? No! No, No, No! I'm not a burglar. I've never stolen a thing in my life.

BALIN
And I'm afraid I have to agree with Mister Baggins. He's hardly burglar material.

DWALIN
Aye, the wild is no place for gentle folk who can neither fight nor fend for themselves.

GANDALF
Enough! If I say Bilbo Baggins is a burglar, then a burglar he is! Hobbits are remarkably light on their feet.
In fact, they can pass unseen by most if they choose, and while the dragon is accustomed to the smell of a dwarf,
the scent of a hobbit is all but unknown to him, which gives us a distinct advantage.
You asked me to find the fourteenth member of this company, and I have chosen Mister Baggins.
There's a lot more to him than appearances suggest.
And he's got a great deal more to offer than any of you know, including himself.

GANDALF
You must trust me on this.

THORIN
Very well. We'll do it your way.

BILBO
No. No-

THORIN
Give him the contract.

BOFUR
Orin. We're off!

BILBO
Please.

BALIN
It's just the usual summary of out-of-pocket expenses, time required, remuneration, funeral arrangements, so forth.

BILBO
Funeral arrangements? Ooh.

THORIN
I cannot guarantee his safety.

GANDALF
Understood.

THORIN
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.

GANDALF
Agreed.

BILBO
'Total's cash on delivery, up to but not exceeding, one fourteenth of total profit if any.'
Seems fair.

BILBO
'The present company shall not be liable for injuries inflicted by or sustained as a consequence thereof,
including, but not limited to- lacerations. Evisceration.'

BILBO
'Incineration'?

BOFUR
Oh, aye, he'll melt the flesh off your bones in the blink of an eye.

BALIN
You alright, laddie?

BILBO
Huh? Yeah, I feel a bit faint.

BOFUR
Think furnace, with wings.

BILBO
I- I need air.

BOFUR
Flash of light, searing pain, then poof! You're nothing more than a pile of ash!

BILBO
No.

GANDALF
Oh, very helpful, Bofur.

BILBO
I'll be alright. Just let me sit quietly for a moment.

GANDALF
You've been sitting quietly for far too long. Tell me, when did doilies and your mother's dishes become so important to you?
I remember a young hobbit who was always running off in search of Elves, in the woods.
He'd stay out late, come home, after dark, trailing mud and twigs and fireflies.
A young hobbit who would've liked nothing better than to find out what was beyond the borders of the Shire.
The world is not in your books and maps. It's out there.

BILBO
I can't just go running off into the blue! I am a Baggins, of Bag End!

GANDALF
You are also a Took. Did you know that your great, great, great,
great uncle Bullroarer Took, was so large he could ride a real horse?

GANDALF
Yes, well he could! In the battle of Greenfields, he charged the goblin ranks he swung his club so hard,
it knocked the goblin king's head clean off, and it sailed a hundred yards through the air, and went down a rabbit hole.
And thus the battle as won, and the game of golf invented at the same time.

BILBO
I do believe you made that up.

GANDALF
Well, all good stories deserve embellishment. You'll have a tale or two to tell of your own when you come back.

BILBO
Can you promise that I will come back?

GANDALF
No. And if you do, you'll not be the same.

BILBO
That's what I thought.

BILBO
Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this. You've got the wrong hobbit.

STOP

BALIN
It appears we have lost our burglar. Probably for the best. The odds were always against us.
After all, what are we? Merchants, miners, tinkers, toy makers. Hardly the stuff of legend.

THORIN
There are a few warriors amongst us.

BALIN
Old warriors.

THORIN
I would take each and every one of these dwarves over an army from the Iron Hills,
for when I called upon them, they answered. Loyalty, honor, a willing heart. I can ask no more than that.

BALIN
You don't have to do this. You have a choice. You've done honorably by our people.
You have built a new life for us in the Blue Mountains. A life of peace and plenty.
A life that is worth more than all the gold in Erebor.

THORIN
From my grandfather to my father, this has come to me.
They dreamt of the day when the dwarves of Erebor would reclaim their homeland. There is no choice, Balin. Not for me.

BALIN
Then we are with you, laddie. We will see it done.

THORIN
Far over the Misty Mountains cold. To dungeons deep and caverns old. We must away ere break of day. To find our long forgotten gold.

DWARVES
The pines were roaring on the height, the winds were moaning in the night.
The fire was red, it flaming spread. The trees like torches blazed with light.

STOP

BILBO
Hello!

HOBBIT
Here, Mister Bilbo! Where are you off too?

BILBO
I can't stop, I'm already late!

HOBBIT
Late for what?

BILBO
I'm going on an adventure!

STOP

BILBO
Wait! Wait!

BILBO
I signed it.

BALIN
Everything appears to be in order. Welcome, master Baggins, to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.

THORIN
Give him a pony.

BILBO
No, no, no, no. That won't be necessary. Thank you. I'm sure I can keep up on foot.
Yeah, I've done my fair share of walking holidays, you know? Even got as far as Frog Morton once.

OIN
Come on, Nori! Pay up!

BILBO
What's that about?

GANDALF
Oh, they took wagers on whether or not you'd turn up. Most of them bet that you wouldn't.

BILBO
And what did you think?

GANDALF
Well my dear fellow, I never doubted you for a second.

BILBO
Oh, it's horse hair. Having a reaction.

BILBO
Wait, wait. Stop! Stop! We have to turn around.

GANDALF
What on earth is the matter?

BILBO
I forgot my handkerchief.

BOFUR
Here! Use this.

THORIN
Move on!

GANDALF
You'll have to manage without pocket handkerchiefs, and a good many other things,
Bilbo Baggins, before we reach our journey's end. You were born to the rolling hills and little rivers of the Shire.
But home is now behind you. The world is ahead.

STOP

BILBO
Good girl! Here's a good girl. It's our little secret, Myrtle. Just tell no one. Shh-shh.

BILBO
What was that?

KILI
Orcs.

BILBO
Orcs?

FILI
Throat cutters. There'd be dozens of them out there. The low lands are crawling with them.

KILI
They strike, in the wee small hours, when everyone's asleep. Quick and quiet, no screams. Just lots of blood.

THORIN
You think that's funny? You think a night raid by orcs is a joke?

KILI
We didn't mean anything by it.

THORIN
No you didn't. You know nothing of the world.

BALIN
Don't mind him, laddie. Thorin has more cause than most to hate orcs.

STOP

BALIN
After the dragon took the Lonely Mountain, King Thror tried to reclaim the ancient dwarf kingdom of Moria.

BALIN
But our enemy had got' there first.

BALIN
Moria had been taken by legions of orcs, led by the most vile of all their race, Azog the Defiler.
The giant Gundabad orc had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin. He began by beheading the king.

BALIN
Thrain, Thorin's father, was driven mad by grief, he went missing, taken prisoner or killed, we did not know.
We were leaderless. Defeat and death were upon us. That is when I saw him. A young dwarf prince facing down the Pale Orc.

BALIN
He stood alone against this terrible foe. His armor rent, wielding nothing but an oaken branch as a shield.

BALIN
Azog the Defiler learned that day, that the line of Durin would not be so easily broken.

BALIN
Our forces rallied, and drove the orcs back. Our enemy had been defeated, but there was no feast,
nor song that night for our dead were beyond the count of grief. We few, had survived.

BALIN
And I thought to myself then, there is one who I could follow, there is one I could call king.

BILBO
And the Pale Orc? What happened to him?

THORIN
He slunk back into the hole whence he came. That filth died of his wounds long ago.

HUNTER ORC
Send word to the Master, we have found the Dwarf-scum.

STOP

DORI
Here, Mister Gandalf? Can't you do something about this deluge?

GANDALF
It is raining, master dwarf. And it will continue to rain until the rain is done!
If you wish to change the weather of the world, you should find yourself another wizard.

BILBO
Are there any?

GANDALF
What?

BILBO
Other wizards?

GANDALF
There are five us. The greatest of our order is Saruman, The White.
Then there are the two blue wizards. Do you know, I've quite forgotten their names.

BILBO
And who is the fifth?

GANDALF
Well, that would be Radagast, The Brown.

BILBO
Is he a great wizard or is he- more like you?

GANDALF
I think he's a very great wizard, in his own way. He's a gentle soul who prefers the company of animals to others.
He keeps a watchful eye over the vast forestlands to the East, and a good thing too,
for always evil will look to find a foothold in this world.

STOP

RADAGAST
Not good. Not good at all!

RADAGAST
Oh. Oh, no! Oh, Sebastian! Good gracious.

RADAGAST
Move back! Give him some air, for goodness sake!

RADAGAST
I don't understand why it's not working, it's not as if it's witchcraft!

RADAGAST
Witchcraft. Oh, but it is! A dark and powerful magic.

RADAGAST
Where on this good earth do those foul creatures come from?

RADAGAST
The old fortress? Show me.

STOP

THORIN
We'll camp here for the night. Fili, Kili, look after the ponies. Make sure you stay with them.

GANDALF
A farmer and his family used to live here.

THORIN
Oin, Gloin.

OIN
Aye?

THORIN
Get the fire going.

OIN
Right you are.

GANDALF
I think it would be wiser to move on. We could make for the hidden valley.

THORIN
But I've told you already. I will not go near that place.

GANDALF
Why not? The Elves could help us, we could get food, rest, advice.

THORIN
I do not need their advice.

GANDALF
We have a map that we cannot read. Lord Elrond could help us.

THORIN
Help? A dragon attacks Erebor. What help came from the Elves? Orcs plunder Moria,
desecrate our sacred halls, the Elves looked on and did nothing!
You ask me to seek out the very people who betrayed my grandfather, who betrayed my father.

GANDALF
You are neither of them. I did not give you that map and key for you to hold on to the past.

THORIN
I did not know they were yours to keep.

BILBO
Everything alright? Gandalf, where are you going?

GANDALF
To seek the company of the only one around here who's got any sense.

BILBO
And who's that?

GANDALF
Myself, Mister Baggins! I've had enough of dwarves for one day.

THORIN
Come on Bombur, we're hungry.

BILBO
Is he coming back?

BILBO
He's been a long time.

BOFUR
Who?

BILBO
Gandalf.

BOFUR
He's a wizard! He does as he chooses. Here. Do us a favor, take this to the lads.

BOFUR
Stop it, you've had plenty.

BILBO
What's the matter?

KILI
We're supposed to be looking after the ponies.

FILI
Only we've encountered a slight problem.

KILI
We had sixteen.

FILI
Now there's fourteen.

KILI
Daisy and Bungle are missing.

BILBO
What? Well, that's not good. And that is not good at all. Shouldn't we tell Thorin?

FILI
Uh- no. Let's not worry him. As our official burglar, we thought you might like to look into it.

BILBO
Well, it looks as if something big uprooted these trees.

KILI
That was our thinking.

BILBO
It's something very big, and possibly quite dangerous.

FILI
Hey! There's a light.

FILI
Over here!

FILI
Stay down.

BILBO
What is it?

KILI
Trolls.

BILBO
He's got Myrtle and Minty! I think they're gonna eat them, we have to do something.

KILI
Yes, you should. Mountain trolls are slow and stupid, and you're so small. They'll never see you.

BILBO
Me? Me? No. No. No.

KILI
It's perfectly safe!

FILI
We'll be right behind you. If you run into trouble hoot twice like a barn owl, once like a brown owl.

BILBO
Twice like a barn owl, hoot twice like a brown- hoots like a-? Are you sure this is a good idea?

STOP

WILLIAM TROLL
Mutton yesterday, mutton today. And blimey, if it don't look like mutton again tomorrow.

BERT TROLL
Quit your griping. These ain't sheep! These is West nags!

TOM TROLL
Oh! I don't like horse. I never have. Not enough fat on them.

WILLIAM TROLL
Well, it's better than a leathery ol' farmer. All skin and bone he was. I'm still pickin' bits of him out o' me teeth.

BERT TROLL
Well, that's lovely, that is. A floater.

WILLIAM TROLL
Oh! Might improve the flavor!

TOM TROLL
Ah! There's more where that came from.

BERT TROLL
Oh, no you don't!

TOM TROLL
Oww! Oww!

BERT TROLL
Sit down!

TOM TROLL
Well I hope you're gonna gut these nags? I don't like the stinky parts.

TOM TROLL
Oww!

BERT TROLL
I said sit down!

WILLIAM TROLL
I'm starving, are we having horse tonight or what?

BERT TROLL
Shut your cake hole! You'll eat what I'll give ya!

WILLIAM TROLL
How come he's the cook? Everything tastes the same, everything tastes like chicken.

TOM TROLL
Except the chicken.

WILLIAM TROLL
What tastes like fish!

BERT TROLL
I'm just saying, a little appreciation would be nice. ‘Thank you very much, Bert. Lovely stew, Bert.' How hard is that?

BERT TROLL
Mmm. Just needs a sprinkle of squirrel dung.

BERT TROLL
Here, that's my grog!

TOM TROLL
Sorry.

TOM TROLL
Oww!

BERT TROLL
Ooh. That is beautifully balanced, that is. Wrap your loganbie around that, mate.

BERT TROLL
Huh? Good ain't it? That's why I'm the cook.

WILLIAM TROLL
Me guts are grumbling, I've got to snaffle something. Flesh. I need flesh!

TOM TROLL
Aah! Blimey! Bert! Bert, look what's come out of me hooter! It's got arms and legs and everything!

BERT TROLL
What is it?

TOM TROLL
I don't know, but I don't like the way it wriggles around!

BERT TROLL
What are you then? An oversized squirrel?

BILBO
I'm a burglar- a hobbit!

TOM TROLL
A ‘burglar-hobbit'?

WILLIAM TROLL
Can we cook him?

TOM TROLL
We can try!

BERT TROLL
He wouldn't make more than a mouthful. Not when he's skinned and boned!

WILLIAM TROLL
Perhaps there's more burglar-hobbits 'round these parts, might be enough for a pie!

WILLIAM TROLL
Grab him!

TOM TROLL
He's too quick!

WILLIAM TROLL
Oah, come here! you little-

WILLIAM TROLL
Gotcha! Are there any more of you little fellas hiding where you shouldn't?

BILBO
No.

TOM TROLL
He's lying!

BILBO
I'm not!

TOM TROLL
Hold his toes over the fire. Make him squeal!

KILI
Drop him!

WILLIAM TROLL
You what?

KILI
I said, drop him.

KILI
Bilbo!

THORIN
No!

WILLIAM TROLL
Lay down your arms! Or we'll rip his off!

TOM TROLL
Don't bother cooking 'em! Let's just sit on 'em and squash 'em into jelly!

BERT TROLL
They should be sauteed and grilled with a sprinkle of sage.

TOM TROLL
Oh, that does sound quite nice.

WILLIAM TROLL
Never mind the seasoning, we ain't got all night! Dawn ain't far away, let's get a move on! I don't fancy been turned to stone.

BILBO
Wait! You are making a terrible mistake.

DORI
You can't reason with them, they're half-wits!

BOFUR
Half-wits? What does that make us?

BILBO
I meant with the, with the- with the seasoning.

BERT TROLL
What about the seasoning?

BILBO
Well, have you smelt them? You're gonna need something stronger than sage before you plate this lot up!

WILLIAM TROLL
What do you know about cooking dwarf?

BERT TROLL
Shut up, and let the- flurgerburbur-hobbit talk.

BILBO
Uh, the secret to cooking dwarf, is-

BERT TROLL
Yes? Come on.

BILBO
It's, uh-

BERT TROLL
Tell us the secret!

BILBO
Ye-yes, I'm telling you. The secret is- to skin them first!

BERT TROLL
Tom, get me filleting knife.

WILLIAM TROLL
What a load of rubbish! I've eaten plenty with their skins on. Scoff 'em I say, boots and all!

TOM TROLL
He's right! Nothing wrong with a bit o' raw dwarf.

TOM TROLL
Nice and crunchy.

BILBO
Not- not that one, he's infected!

WILLIAM TROLL
You what?

BILBO
Yeah he's got worms in his tubes.

TOM TROLL
Ooh!

BILBO
In-in fact, they all have. They're infested with parasites, it's a terrible business, I wouldn't risk it, I really wouldn't.

OIN
Parasites? Did he say parasites?

KILI
Yeah, we don't have parasites!

KILI
You have parasites!

OIN
I've got parasites as big as my arm!

KILI
Mine are the biggest parasites, I've got huge parasites!

NORI
We're riddled!

ORI
Yes, I'm riddled!

DORI
Yes, we are, badly!

WILLIAM TROLL
What would you have us do then? Let 'em all go?

BILBO
Well-

WILLIAM TROLL
You think I don't know what you're up to. This little ferret is taking us for fools!

BILBO
Ferret?

BERT TROLL
Fools?

GANDALF
The dawn will take you all!

WILLIAM TROLL
Who's that?

BERT TROLL
No idea.

TOM TROLL
Can we eat him too?

DWALIN
Ooh, get your foot out of my back!

THORIN
Where did you go to, if I may ask?

GANDALF
To look ahead.

THORIN
What brought you back?

GANDALF
Looking behind. Nasty business. Still they all are in one piece.

THORIN
No thanks to your burglar.

GANDALF
He had the nous to play for time. None of the rest of you thought of that.

GANDALF
They must have come down from the Ettenmoors.

THORIN
Since when the mountain trolls venture this far south?

GANDALF
Oh, not for an age. Not since a darker power ruled these lands.

GANDALF
They could not have moved in daylight.

THORIN
There must be a cave nearby.

STOP

BOFUR
Oh, what's that stench?

GANDALF
It's a troll hoard. Be careful what you touch.

BOFUR
Seems a shame just to leave it lying around. Anyone could take it.

GLOIN
Agreed. Nori, get a shovel.

THORIN
These swords were not made by any troll.

GANDALF
Nor were they made by any smith among men.

GANDALF
These were forged in Gondolin, by the High Elves, of the First Age. You could not wish for a finer blade.

GLOIN
We're making a long-term deposit.

THORIN
Let's get out of this foul place. Come on, let's go. Bofur, Gloin, Nori.

GANDALF
Bilbo.

BILBO
Hm?

GANDALF
Here. This is about your size.

BILBO
I can't take this.

GANDALF
The blade is of Elvish make, which means it will glow blue when orcs or goblins are nearby.

BILBO
I have never used a sword in my life.

GANDALF
And I hope you never have to. But if you do, remember this
true courage is about knowing not when to take a life, but when to spare one.

STOP

THORIN
Something's coming!

BILBO
Gandalf.

GANDALF
Stay together! Hurry, now! Arm yourselves!

RADAGAST
Thieves! Fire! Murder!

GANDALF
Radagast. It's Radagast the Brown!

GANDALF
What on earth are you doing here?

RADAGAST
I was looking for you, Gandalf. Something's wrong. Something's terribly wrong.

GANDALF
Yes?

RADAGAST
Just give me a minute - oh! I had a thought and now I've lost it.
It was right there, on the tip of my tongue! Oh! It's not a thought at all! It's a silly old stick insect.

RADAGAST
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf. A darkness has fallen over it, nothing grows anymore.
At least nothing good. The air is foul decay, but worse are the webs.

GANDALF
Webs? What do you mean?

RADAGAST
Spiders, Gandalf. Giant ones. Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant,
or I'm not a wizard. I followed their trail. They came from Dol Guldur.

GANDALF
Dol Guldur? But the old fortress is abandoned.

RADAGAST
No, Gandalf. It is not.

RADAGAST
A dark power dwells in there, such as I have never felt before.
It is the shadow of an ancient horror. One that can summon the spirits of the dead.

RADAGAST
I saw him, Gandalf. From out of the darkness, the Necromancer has come!

RADAGAST
Sorry.

GANDALF
Try a little old Toby. It'll help setting your nerves.

GANDALF
And out.

GANDALF
Now, the Necromancer. Are you sure?

RADAGAST
That is not from the world of the living.

BILBO
Was that a wolf? Are there wolves out there?

BOFUR
Wolves? No, that is not a wolf.

THORIN
Warg scouts! Which means an orc pack is not far behind!

BILBO
Orc pack?

GANDALF
Who did you tell about your quest, beyond your kin?

THORIN
No one.

GANDALF
Who did you tell?

THORIN
No one, I swear! What in Durin's name is going on?

GANDALF
You are being hunted.

DWALIN
We have to get out of here.

ORI
We can't! We have no ponies. They bolted.

RADAGAST
I'll draw them off.

GANDALF
These are Gundabad wargs. They will outrun you!

RADAGAST
These are Rhosgobel rabbits. I'd like to see them try.

RADAGAST
Come and get me!

GANDALF
Come on!

GANDALF
Stay together.

THORIN
Move!

THORIN
Ori, no! Come back.

GANDALF
All of you, come on, come on! Quick!

THORIN
Where are you leading us?

HUNTER ORC
The Dwarf-scum are over there! After them!

GANDALF
Move! Run!

GLOIN
There they are!

GANDALF
This way! Quickly!

KILI
There's more coming!

THORIN
Ki­li! Shoot them!

FILI
We're surrounded!

FILI
Where's Gandalf?

DWALIN
He's abandoned us!

THORIN
Hold your ground!

GANDALF
This way, you fools!

THORIN
Come on, move! Quickly! All of you!

THORIN
Go, go, go!

GANDALF
nine, ten-

THORIN
Kili! Run!

THORIN
Elves.

DWALIN
I cannot see where the pathway leads. Do we follow it or not?

BOFUR
We follow it, of course!

GANDALF
I think that would be wise.

STOP

GANDALF
The Valley of Imladris. In the common tongue, it's known by another name.

BILBO
Rivendell.

GANDALF
Here lies the last homely house, east of the sea.

THORIN
This was your plan all along, to seek refuge with our enemy.

GANDALF
You have no enemies here, Thorin Oakenshield. The only ill-will to be found in this valley is that which you bring yourself.

THORIN
You think the Elves will give our quest their blessing? They will try to stop us.

GANDALF
Of course, they will. But we have questions that need to be answered.
If we are to be successful this will need to be handled with tact, and respect,
and no small degree of charm, which is why you will leave the talking to me.

LINDIR
Mithrandir.

GANDALF
Ah, Lindir.

THORIN
Stay sharp.

LINDIR
We heard you had crossed into the Valley.

GANDALF
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

LINDIR
My Lord Elrond is not here.

GANDALF
Not here? Where is he?

THORIN
Close ranks!

ELROND
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Lord Elrond.

GANDALF
My friend! Where have you been?

ELROND
We've been hunting a pack of Orcs that came up from the South. We slew a number near the Hidden Pass.

ELROND
Strange for orcs to come so close to our borders. Something or someone has drawn them near.

GANDALF
Ah, that may have been us.

ELROND
Welcome Thorin, son of Thrain.

THORIN
I do not believe we have met.

ELROND
You have your Grandfather's bearing. I knew Thror when he ruled under the mountain.

THORIN
Indeed? He made no mention of you.

GLOIN
What is he saying? Does he offer us insult?

GANDALF
No, Master Gloin, he's offering you food.

GLOIN
Ah, Well. In that case, lead on.

STOP

DORI
Try it. Just a mouthful.

ORI
I don't like green food.

DWALIN
Where's the meat?

ORI
Have they got any chips?

GANDALF
Kind of you to invite us. I'm not really dressed for dinner.

ELROND
Well, you never are.

STOP

ELROND
This is Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver. A famous blade, forged by the High Elves of the West. My kin.

ELROND
May it serve you well.

ELROND
And this is Glamdring. The Foe-hammer, sword of the King of Gondolin. These swords were made for the Goblin wars of the First Age.

BALIN
I wouldn't bother, laddie. Swords are named for their great deeds they do in war.

BILBO
What are you saying, my sword hasn't seen battles?

BALIN
I'm not actually sure it is a sword. More of a letter opener, really.

ELROND
How did you come by these?

GANDALF
We found them in a troll hoard on the Great East road, shortly before we were ambushed by orcs.

ELROND
And what were you doing on the Great East road?

THORIN
Our business is no concern of Elves.

GANDALF
For goodness sake. Thorin, show him the map!

THORIN
It is the legacy of my people. It's mine to protect! As are its secrets.

GANDALF
Save me from the stubbornness of dwarves. Your pride will be your downfall.
You stand here in the presence of one of the few in Middle-earth who can read that map. Show it to Lord Elrond!

BALIN
Thorin, no!

ELROND
Erebor. What is your interest in this map?

GANDALF
It's mainly academic. As you know, this sort of artifacts sometimes contains hidden text.

GANDALF
You still read ancient dwarvish, do you not?

ELROND
‘Cirth ithil'.

GANDALF
Moon runes. Of course. An easy thing to miss.

ELROND
Well in this case, that is true.
Moon runes can only be read by the light of the moon of the same shape and season as the day on which they were written.

THORIN
Can you read them?

ELROND
These runes were written on a mid-summer's eve by the light of a crescent moon nearly two hundred years ago.
It would seem you were meant to come to Rivendell.
Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield. The same moon shines upon us tonight.

ELROND
‘Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks, and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.'

BILBO
Durin's Day?

GANDALF
It is the start of the dwarves new year, when the last moon of Autumn and the first sun of Winter appear in the sky together.

THORIN
This is ill news. Summer is passing, Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

BALIN
We still have time.

BILBO
Time, for what?

BALIN
To find the entrance. We have to be standing at exactly the right spot, at exactly the right time.
Then, and only then, can the door be opened.

ELROND
So this is your purpose, to enter the mountain.

THORIN
What of it?

ELROND
There are some who would not deem it wise.

GANDALF
Who do you mean?

ELROND
You are not the only guardian to stand watch over Middle-earth.

STOP

HUNTER ORC
The Dwarves, Master, we lost them. Ambushed by Elvish filth, we were-

AZOG
I don't want excuses. I want the head of the Dwarf King!

HUNTER ORC
We were outnumbered, there was nothing we could do. I barely escaped with my life.

AZOG
Far better you had paid with it.

AZOG
The Dwarf-scum will show themselves soon enough.

AZOG
Send out word, there is a price on their heads!

STOP

GANDALF
With or without our help, these dwarves will march on the mountain. They're determined to reclaim their homeland. I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield feels that he's answerable to anyone. Nor for that matter am I.

ELROND
But it's not me you must answer to.

GANDALF
Lady Galadriel.

GALADRIEL
Mithrandir.

GANDALF
It has been a long time.

GALADRIEL
Age may have changed me, but not so the lady of Lorien.

GALADRIEL
I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you.

SARUMAN
He didn't. I did.

GALADRIEL
Saruman.

SARUMAN
You've been busy of late, my friend.

SARUMAN
Tell me, Gandalf, did you think these plans and schemes of yours would go unnoticed?

GANDALF
Unnoticed? No, I'm simply doing what I feel to be right.

GALADRIEL
The dragon has long been on your mind.

GANDALF
It is true, my Lady. Smaug owes allegiance to no one. But if he should side with the enemy, the dragon could be used to terrible effect.

SARUMAN
What enemy? Gandalf, the enemy is defeated. Sauron is vanquished. He can never regain his full strength.

ELROND
Gandalf, for four hundred years we have lived in peace. A hard won watchful peace.

GANDALF
Are we? Are we at peace? Trolls have come down from the mountains, they are raiding villages, destroying farms. Orcs have attacked us on the road.

ELROND
Hardly a prelude to war.

SARUMAN
Always you must meddle. Looking for trouble where none exists!

GALADRIEL
Let him speak.

GANDALF
There is something at work beyond the evil of Smaug, something far more powerful.
We can remain blind to it, but it will not be ignoring us, that I can promise you.
A sickness hides over the Greenwood. The woodsmen who live there now call it Mirkwood, and they say-

SARUMAN
Well, don't stop now, tell us what the woodsmen say?

GANDALF
They speak of a Necromancer, living in Dol Guldur, a sorcerer who can summon the dead.

SARUMAN
That's absurd. No such power exists in this world.
This Necromancer is nothing more than a mortal man. A conjurer dabbling in black magic.

GANDALF
And so I though too. But Radagast has seen-

SARUMAN
Radagast? Do not speak to me of Radagast the Brown. He's a foolish fellow.

GANDALF
Well, he's odd, I grant you. He lives a solitary life.

SARUMAN
It's not that. It's his excessive consumption of mushrooms. They've addled his brain,
and yellowed his teeth. I warned him. It is unbefitting one of the Istari wandering the wood.

GALADRIEL
You carry something. It came to you from Radagast, he found it in Dol Guldur.

GANDALF
Yes.

GALADRIEL
Show me.

ELROND
What is that?

GALADRIEL
A relic of Mordor.

ELROND
A Morgul blade.

GALADRIEL
Made for the witch-king of Angmar, and buried with him. When Angmar fell, the men of the North took his body,
and all that he possessed and sealed it within the high fells of Rhudaur. Deep within the rock they buried him,
in a tomb so dark it would never come to light.

ELROND
This is not possible. A powerful spell lies upon those tombs, they cannot be opened.

SARUMAN
What proof do we have this weapon came from Angmar's grave?

GANDALF
I have none.

SARUMAN
Because there is none. Let us examine what we know. A single orc pack has dared to cross the Bruinen.
A dagger from a by-gone age has been found. And a human sorcerer who calls himself the Necromancer,
has taken up residence in a ruined fortress. It's not so very much, after all.
The question of this dwarvish company however, troubles me deeply. I'm not convinced, Gandalf.
I do not feel I can condone such a quest. If they'd come to me, I might have spare them this disappointment.
I will not pretend to understand your reasons for raising their hopes.

GALADRIEL
They are leaving.

GANDALF
Yes.

GALADRIEL
You knew.

SARUMAN
- I'm afraid there's nothing else for it.

LINDIR
My Lord Elrond. The dwarves, they've gone.

STOP

THORIN
Be on your guard, we're about to step over the Edge of the Wild. Balin, you know these paths, lead on.

BALIN
Aye.

THORIN
Master Baggins, I suggest you keep up.

STOP

GALADRIEL
You will follow them.

GANDALF
Yes.

GALADRIEL
You are right to help Thorin Oakenshield. But I fear this quest has set in motion forces we do not yet understand.
The riddle of the Morgul blade must be answered. Something moves in the shadows, unseen, hidden from our side,
it will not show itself, not yet. But every day it grows in strength. You must be careful.

GANDALF
Yes.

GALADRIEL
Mithrandir.

GALADRIEL
Why the Halfling?

GANDALF
I do not know. Saruman believes that it is only a great power that can hold evil in check,
but that is not what I have found. I've found it is the small things, everyday deeds of ordinary folk,
that keep the darkness at bay. Simple acts of kindness and love. Why Bilbo Baggins?
Perhaps it is because I'm afraid and he gives me courage.

GALADRIEL
Do not be afraid, Mithrandir. You are not alone.

GALADRIEL
If you should ever need my help, I will come.

STOP

THORIN
Alright, hold on!

THORIN
We must find shelter!

DWALIN
Look out!

BIFUR
Hold on!

BALIN
This is no thunderstorms! It's a thunder-battle! Look!

BOFUR
Well bless me. The legends are true! Giants! Stone giants!

THORIN
Take cover, you fool!

NORI
Hold on!

FILI
Ki­li, grab my hand!

BALIN
We're alright! We're alive!

BOFUR
Where's Bilbo? Where's the hobbit?

THORIN
Get him!

BOFUR
Grab my hand! Bilbo! Come on and take it!

DWALIN
I thought we'd lost our burglar.

THORIN
He's been lost ever since he left home. He should never have come. He has no place amongst us.

THORIN
Dwalin!

DWALIN
It looks safe enough.

THORIN
Search to the back, caves in the mountains are seldom unoccupied.

DWALIN
There's nothing here.

GLOIN
Right then, let's get a fire started.

THORIN
No. No fires. Not in this place. Get some sleep, we start at first light.

BALIN
We were to wait in the mountains until Gandalf joined us. That was the plan.

THORIN
Plans change. Bofur, take the first watch.

AZOG
The scent is fresh! They have taken the mountain pass.

STOP

BOFUR
Where do you think you're going?

BILBO
Back to Rivendell.

BOFUR
No. No. No. You can't turn back, now. You're part of the company. You're one of us.

BILBO
I'm not though, am I? Thorin said I should never have come, and he was right.
I'm not a Took, I'm a Baggins, I don't know what I was thinking. I should've never run out the door.

BOFUR
You're homesick, I understand.

BILBO
No, you don't! You don't understand, none of you do, you're dwarves! You're used to this life,
to living on the road, never settling in one place, not belonging anywhere!

BILBO
I'm sorry. I didn't-

BOFUR
No, you're right. We don't belong anywhere.

BOFUR
I wish you all the luck in the world. I really do.

BOFUR
What's that?

THORIN
Wake up. Wake up!

STOP

GREAT GOBLIN
Who would be so bold as to come armed into my kingdom? Spies? Thieves? Assassins?

GOBLIN
Dwarves, your Malevolence.

GREAT GOBLIN
Dwarves?

GOBLIN
We found them on the front porch.

GREAT GOBLIN
Well don't just stand there, search them! Every crack, every crevice!

GREAT GOBLIN
What are you doing in these parts? Speak!

GREAT GOBLIN
Very well, if they will not talk, we'll make them squawk!
Bring up the mangler, bring up the bone breaker! Start with the youngest.

THORIN
Wait!

GREAT GOBLIN
Well, well, well! Look who it is! Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror, king under the mountain.

GREAT GOBLIN
Oh! But I'm forgetting you don't have mountain, and you're not a king. Which makes you nobody really.
I know someone who would pay a pretty price for your head. Just the head, nothing attached.
Perhaps you know of whom I speak, an old enemy of yours. A pale orc astride a white warg.

THORIN
Azog the Defiler was destroyed. He was slain in battle long ago

GREAT GOBLIN
So you think his defiling days are done, do you?

GREAT GOBLIN
Send word to the pale orc, tell him I have found his prize.

STOP

GOLLUM
Yesss. Yes! Yes. Gollum. Yes! Gollum! Gollum!

GOLLUM
Nasty goblinses are better than old bones, precious. Better than nothing.

GOLLUM
Aah, too many boneses, precious! Not enough flesh. Shut up! Cut its skin off! Start with its head.

GOLLUM
The cold hard lands, they bites our hands, they gnaws our feet,
for rocks and stones are like old bones all bare of meat, cold as death, without no breath it's good to eat.

GOLLUM
Bless us and splash us, precious. That's a meaty mouthful.

GOLLUM
Gollum, Gollum!

BILBO
Back. Stay back. I'm warning you, don't come any closer.

GOLLUM
It's got an Elfish blade, but it's not an Elfes. Not an Elfes, no. What is it, precious? What is it?

BILBO
My name is Bilbo Baggins.

GOLLUM
Bagginses. What is a Bagginses, precious?

BILBO
I'm a- hobbit from the Shire.

GOLLUM
Oh! We like goblinses, batses and fishes, but we hasn't tried Hobbitses before! Is it soft? Is it juicy?

BILBO
Now! Now, k-keep your distance!

BILBO
I'll use this, if I have too.

BILBO
I don't - want any trouble, you understand? Just show me the way to get out of here, and I'll be on my way.

GOLLUM
Why? Is it lost?

BILBO
Yes. Yes, and I want to get unlost, as soon as possible.

GOLLUM
Oh, we knows! We knows safe path for hobbitses. Safe path in the dark. Shut up!

BILBO
I didn't say anything.

GOLLUM
I wasn't talking to you!

GOLLUM
Oh yes, we was, precious, we was.

BILBO
Look, I don't know what your game is, but I-

GOLLUM
Games? Oh, we love games, doesn't we, precious? Does it like games? Does it, does it, does it like to play?

BILBO
Maybe.

GOLLUM
What has roots as nobody sees, is taller than trees, up, up, up it goes, and yet never grows?

BILBO
The mountain.

GOLLUM
Yes! Yes! Ooh, let's have another one, huh? Yes. Go, do it again. Do it, do it again, ask us.

GOLLUM
No! No more riddles. Finish him off, finish him now! Gollum, Gollum!

BILBO
No! No, no, no. I want to play. I do. I want to play. I can see you are very good at this.
So why don't we have a game of riddles? Yes, just- just you and me.

GOLLUM
Yes. Just us.

BILBO
Yes, yes! And if I win, you will show me the way out. Yes?

GOLLUM
Yes. Yes!

GOLLUM
And if it loses, what then? Well, if it loses, precious, then we eats it!

GOLLUM
If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.

BILBO
Fair enough.

GOLLUM
The Baggins first.

BILBO
Thirty white horses on a red hill. First they champ, then they stamp, then they stand still.

GOLLUM
Teeth?

GOLLUM
Teeth!

GOLLUM
Yes, my precious! But we only have nine.

GOLLUM
Our turn. Voiceless it cries, wingless flutters, toothless bites, mouthless mutters.

BILBO
Just a minute.

GOLLUM
Ooh! We knows, we knows!

GOLLUM
Shut up!

BILBO
Wind.

BILBO
It's wind! Of course it is.

GOLLUM
Very clever, hobbitses. Very clever!

BILBO
A box without hinges, key or lid, yet golden treasure inside is hid.

BILBO
Well?

GOLLUM
It's nasty.

BILBO
Give up?

GOLLUM
Give us a chance, precious! Give us a chance!

GOLLUM
Eggses! Eggses! Wet, crunchy little eggses, yes. Grandmother taught us to suck them, yes!

GOLLUM
We have one for you. All things it devours; birds, beasts, trees, flowers.
Gnaws iron, bites steel, Grinds hard stones to meal. Answer us.

BILBO
Give me a moment, please. I gave you a good long while.

BILBO
I don't know this one.

GOLLUM
Is it tasty? Is it scrumptious? Is it crunchable!

BILBO
Let me think! Let me think.

GOLLUM
It's stuck. Bagginses is stuck. Time's up.

BILBO
Time? Ti- The answer is Time.

BILBO
Actually, it wasn't that hard.

GOLLUM
Last question. Last chance.

BILBO
Okay. Uh-

GOLLUM
Ask us. Ask us!

BILBO
Yes. Yes, alright.

BILBO
What have I got in my pocket?

GOLLUM
Well, that's no fair. It's no fair! It's against the rules!

GOLLUM
You ask us another one.

BILBO
No. No, no, no. You said, ask me a question. Well that is my question. What have I got in my pocket?

GOLLUM
Three guesses, precious. He must give us three!

BILBO
Three guesses, very well, guess away.

GOLLUM
Handses!

BILBO
Wrong. Guess again.

GOLLUM
Uuh! Fish bones, goblin's teeth, wet shells, bat's wings! Oooh! Aaah!

GOLLUM
Knife!

GOLLUM
No, shut up!

BILBO
Wrong, again. Last guess.

GOLLUM
String! Or nothing.

BILBO
Two guesses at once. Wrong both times.

BILBO
So. Come then. I won the game, you promised to show me the way out.

GOLLUM
Did we say so, precious? Did we say so?

GOLLUM
What has it got in its pocketses?

BILBO
That's no concern of yours. You lost.

GOLLUM
Lost. Lost? Lost?

GOLLUM
Where is it? Where is it?

GOLLUM
No! Aaah! Where is it? Nooo! Lost, lost! Curse us and splash us, my precious is lost!

BILBO
What have you lost?

GOLLUM
Mustn't ask us! Not its business! Nooo! Gollum! Gollum!

GOLLUM
What has it got in its nasty little pocketses?

GOLLUM
He stole it. He stole it! Aaah! He stole it!

STOP

GREAT GOBLIN
Bones will be shattered, necks will be wrung, and you'll be beaten and battered, from racks you'll be hung.
You will die down here and never be found, down in the deep of Goblin town.

GREAT GOBLIN
I know that sword! It is the Goblin-cleaver! The Biter! The blade that sliced a thousand necks!

GREAT GOBLIN
Slash them, beat them, peel them, kill them all!

GREAT GOBLIN
Cut off his head!

GANDALF
Take up arms. Fight. Fight!

GREAT GOBLIN
He wields the Foe-hammer, the beater, bright as daylight!

GANDALF
Follow me. Quick! Run!

STOP

GOLLUM
Give it to us!

GOLLUM
It's ours. It's ours!

GOLLUM
Thief! Baggins!

STOP

GREAT GOBLIN
You thought you could escape me!

GREAT GOBLIN
What are you going to do now, wizard?

GREAT GOBLIN
*stertorous* That'll do it.

STOP

BOFUR
Well, that could have been worse.

DWALIN
You've got to be joking!

KILI
Gandalf!

DWALIN
There's too many, we can't fight them.

GANDALF
Only one thing will save us. Daylight! Come on!

GANDALF
Here, on your feet.

STOP

GOLLUM
Wait, my precious. Wait! Gollum! Gollum!

GOLLUM
Baggins! Thief! Curse it and crush it, we hates it forever!

STOP

GANDALF
Five, six, seven, eight. Bifur, Bofur, that's ten. Fili, Ki­li, that's twelve.
And Bombur, that makes thirteen. Where's Bilbo? Where is our hobbit? Where is our hobbit?

GLOIN
Curse that Halfling! Now he's lost! I thought he was with Dori!

DORI
Don't blame me!

GANDALF
And where did you last see him?

BIFUR
I think I saw him slip away when they first collared us.

GANDALF
What happened exactly? Tell me!

THORIN
I'll tell you what happened. Master Baggins saw his chance and he took it!
He's thought of nothing but his soft bed and his warm hearth since first he stepped out of his door.
We will not be seeing our hobbit again, he is long gone.

BILBO
No, he isn't.

GANDALF
Bilbo Baggins. I've never been so glad to see anyone in my life.

KILI
Bilbo, we'd given you up!

FILI
How on earth did you get past the goblins?

DWALIN
How indeed?

GANDALF
Oh, what does it matter? He's back.

THORIN
It matters. I want to know. Why did you come back?

BILBO
Look, I know you doubt me. I know you always have. And you're right, I often think of Bag End.
I miss my books, and my arm chair, and my garden. See, that's where I belong. That's home.
And that's why I came back, cause- you don't have one. A home. It was taken from you, but I will help you take it back if I can.

STOP

AZOG
Run them down! Tear them to pieces!

THORIN
Out of the frying pan.

GANDALF
And into the fire. Run. Run!

GANDALF
Up into the trees. All of you! Come on, climb! Bilbo, climb!

THORIN
They're coming!

THORIN
Azog!

AZOG
Do you smell it? The scent of fear? I remember your father reeked of it, Thorin son of Thrain.

THORIN
It cannot be.

AZOG
That one is mine. Kill the others!

AZOG
Drink their blood!

GANDALF
Fili!

DORI
Mister Gandalf! Aah!

AZOG
Bring me the Dwarf's head.

AZOG
Kill him.

GANDALF
Thorin! Thorin.

STOP

THORIN
The Halfling?

GANDALF
It's alright. Bilbo is here, he's quite safe.

THORIN
You! What were you doing? You nearly got yourself killed! Did I not say that you would be a burden?
That you would not survive in the wild, and you had no place amongst us?

THORIN
I have never been so wrong, in all my life.

THORIN
But, I'm sorry I doubted you.

BILBO
No, I would have doubted me too. I'm not a hero, nor a warrior. Not even a burglar.

BILBO
Is that what I think it is?

GANDALF
Erebor! The Lonely Mountain. The last of the Great Dwarf Kingdoms of Middle-earth.

THORIN
Our home.

OIN
A raven! The birds are returning to the mountain.

GANDALF
That, my dear Oin, is a thrush.

THORIN
Well we'll take it as a sign, a good omen.

BILBO
You're right. I do believe the worst is behind us.

STOP

MAN AT BAR
I'm dying of thirst over here! Come on! Come on!

BARTENDER
Here you are.

BARMAID
Watch it!

BAR PATRON
Sorry, darling.

BARMAID
Here you are.

THORIN
Ah, thank you.

GANDALF
Mind if I join you?

GANDALF
I'll have the same.

GANDALF
I should introduce myself. My name is Gandalf. Gandalf the Grey.

THORIN
I know who you are.

GANDALF
Well, now, this is a fine chance. What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?

THORIN
I received word that my Father had been seen wandering the wilds near Dunland. I went looking, found no sign of him.

GANDALF
Thorin, it's been a long time since anything but rumor was heard of Thrain.

THORIN
He still lives, I am sure of it.

THORIN
My father came to see you before he went missing. What did you say to him?

GANDALF
I urged him to march upon Erebor, to rally the seven armies of the dwarves.
To destroy the dragon and take back the Lonely Mountain,
and I would say the same to you. Take back your homeland.

THORIN
This is no chance meeting is it, Gandalf?

GANDALF
No, it is not. The Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin. That dragon has sat there long enough,
sooner or later darker minds will turn towards Erebor.
I ran into some unsavory characters whilst traveling along the Greenway. They mistook me for a vagabond.

THORIN
I imagine they regretted that.

GANDALF
One of them was carrying a message.

GANDALF
It is Black Speech.

GANDALF
A promise of payment.

THORIN
For what?

GANDALF
Your head. Someone wants you dead. Thorin, you can wait no longer. You are the heir to the throne of Durin.
Unite the armies of the dwarves, together you have the might and power to retake Erebor.
Summon a meeting of the seven dwarf families, demand they stand by their oath.

THORIN
The seven armies swore that oath to the one who wields the King's jewel, the Arkenstone.
It is the only thing that will unite them, and in case you have forgotten, that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

GANDALF
What if I were to help you reclaim it?

THORIN
How? The Arkenstone lies half a world away, buried beneath the feet of a fire breathing dragon.

GANDALF
Yes, it does. Which is why we're going to need a burglar.

STOP

THORIN
How close is the pack?

BILBO
Too close, couple of leagues, no more. But that's not the worst of it.

DWALIN
Have the Orcs picked up our scent?

BILBO
Not yet, but they will do. We have another problem.

GANDALF
Did they see you? They saw you.

BILBO
No, that's not it.

GANDALF
Good, what did I tell you? Quite as a mouse. Excellent burglar material.

BILBO
Will you listen! I'm trying to tell you there is something else out there.

GANDALF
What form did it take? Like a bear?

BILBO
Yes, but bigger. Much bigger.

BOFUR
You knew about this beast?

BOFUR
I say we double back.

THORIN
We'll be run down by a pack of Orcs.

GANDALF
There is a house, it's not far from here, where we might take refuge.

THORIN
Whose house? Are they friend or foe?

GANDALF
Neither. He will help us or he will kill us.

THORIN
What choice do we have?

GANDALF
None.

STOP

GANDALF
This way! Quickly!

GANDALF
Into the house! Run!

GANDALF
Come on! Get inside!

GANDALF
Open the door!

THORIN
Quickly!

DWALIN
Come on, lads!

ORI
What is that?

GANDALF
That is our host.
His name is Beorn, he's a skin-changer. Sometimes he's a huge black bear, sometimes he's a great strong man.
The bear is unpredictable, but the man can be reasoned with. However, he is not over fond of dwarves.

ORI
He's leaving.

DORI
Come away from there! It's not natural, none of it. It's obvious, he's under some dark spell.

GANDALF
Don't be a fool. He's under no enchantment but his own.

GANDALF
Alright now, get some sleep all of you. You'll be safe here tonight.

GANDALF
I hope.

STOP

NARZUG
Attack them now. Kill the Dwarf filth while they sleep.

AZOG
No. The Beast stands guard.

AZOG
We will kill them on the road.

BOLG
They are gathering in Dol Guldur. The Master has summoned you.

STOP

THE NECROMANCER
We grow in number. We grow in strength. You will lead my armies.

AZOG
What of Oakenshield?

THE NECROMANCER
War is coming.

AZOG
You promised me his head.

THE NECROMANCER
Death will come to all.

STOP

NARZUG
Do we call off the hunt?

AZOG
Bolg! I have a task for you. Do you still thirst for Dwarf blood?

STOP

BEORN
So you are the one they call Oakenshield. Tell me, why is Azog the Defiler hunting you?

THORIN
You know of Azog? How?

BEORN
My people were the first to live in the mountains, before the Orcs came down from the north.
The Defiler killed most of my family, but some he enslaved. Not for work, you understand, but for sport.
Caging skin-changers and torturing them seemed to amuse him.

BILBO
There are others like you?

BEORN
Once there were many.

BILBO
And now?

BEORN
Now there's only one. You need to reach the mountain before the last days of autumn.

GANDALF
Before Durin's Day falls, yes.

BEORN
You are running out of time.

GANDALF
Which is why we must go through Mirkwood.

BEORN
A darkness lies upon that forest, fell things creep beneath those trees.
There is an alliance between the Orcs of Moria and The Necromancer in Dol Guldur.
I would not venture there, except in great need.

GANDALF
We will take the Elven Road, their path is still safe.

BEORN
Safe? The Wood Elves of Mirkwood are not like their kin. They're less wise and more dangerous. But it matters not.

THORIN
What do you mean?

BEORN
These lands are crawling with Orcs, their numbers are growing and you are on foot.
You will never reach the forest alive. I don't like dwarves, they're greedy and blind,
blind to the lives of those they deem lesser than their own.
But Orcs I hate more.

BEORN
What do you need?

BEORN
Go now, while you have the light. Your hunters are not far behind.

STOP

GANDALF
The Elven Gate.

GANDALF
Here lies our path through Mirkwood.

DWALIN
No sign of the Orcs. We have luck on our side.

GANDALF
Set the ponies loose. Let them return to their master.

BILBO
This forest feels sick, as if a disease lies upon it. Is there no way around?

GANDALF
Not unless we go two hundred miles north, or twice that distance south.

GALADRIEL
Something moves in the shadows, unseen, hidden from our sight. Every day it grows in strength. Beware of The Necromancer, he is not what he seems.

GALADRIEL
If our enemy has returned, we must know. Go to the tombs in the mountains.

GANDALF
The High Fells. So be it.

GANDALF
Not my horse, I need it!

BILBO
You're not leaving us?

GANDALF
I would not do this unless I had to.

GANDALF
You've changed, Bilbo Baggins. You're not the same hobbit as the one who left the Shire.

BILBO
I was going to tell you.

BILBO
I found something in the Goblin tunnels.

GANDALF
Found what?

GANDALF
What did you find?

BILBO
My courage.

GANDALF
Good. Well, that's good. You'll need it.

GANDALF
I'll be waiting for you at the overlook, before the slopes of Erebor.

GANDALF
Keep the map and key safe. Do not enter that mountain without me.

GANDALF
This is not the Greenwood of old, the very air of the forest is heavy with illusion that will seek to enter your mind and lead you astray.

BILBO
Lead us astray? What does that mean?

GANDALF
You must stay on the path, do not leave it. If you do, you'll never find it again.

GANDALF
No matter what may come, stay on the path!

THORIN
Come on, we must reach the mountain before the sun sets on Durin's Day. Let's go, we've but one chance to find the hidden door.

STOP

THORIN
The path turns this way.

DWALIN
This way.

BOFUR
Air, I need air.

OIN
My head, it's spinning! What's happening?

THORIN
Keep moving.

THORIN
Nori, why have you stopped?

NORI
The path, it's disappeared!

ORI
What's going on?

BOFUR
We've lost the path!

THORIN
Find it. All of you, look.

DWALIN
Look for the path!

BALIN
I don't remember this place, none of it's familiar.

DORI
It's got to be here.

THORIN
What hour is it?

DWALIN
I don't know, I don't even know what day it is.

THORIN
Is there no end to this accursed forest!

DORI
Look, a tobacco pouch. There's Dwarves in these woods.

BOFUR
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains, no less. This is exactly the same as mine.

BILBO
Because it is yours, do you understand? We're going around in circles, we are lost!

THORIN
We are not lost. We keep heading east.

DWALIN
But which way is the east? We've lost the sun!

BILBO
The sun. We have to find the sun.
Up there. We need to-

THORIN
Enough! Quiet! All of you! We are being watched.

BILBO
I can see a lake! And a river. And the Lonely Mountain!

BILBO
We're almost there!

BILBO
Can you hear me? I know which way to go!
Hello? Look, come on!

STOP

SPIDER #1
Kill them. Kill them! Eat them now while all their blood is running.

SPIDER #2
Their hide is tough. This could be juicy inside.

SPIDER #1
Stick it again. Stick it again. Finish it off.

SPIDER #2
The meat's alive and kicking.

SPIDER #1
Kill them, kill them now. Let us feast, feast, feast. Feast, feast!

SPIDER #2
Kill them now!

SPIDER #1
Feast! Feast!

SPIDER #1
What is it? What is it? What is it?

SPIDER #2
Fat and juicy! Just a little taste.

SPIDER #2
Curse it! Where is it? Where is it?

BILBO
Here!

SPIDER #2
It stings! It stings!

BILBO
Sting. That's a good name. Sting.

BOFUR
Where's Bilbo?

BILBO
I'm up here!

BILBO
Where is it? Where is it? Come on! Where is it?

BILBO
No! No! No!

THORIN
Dwalin! Kill it! Kill it!

DWALIN
Come on, keep up!

THORIN
Clear!

STOP

LEGOLAS
Do not think I won't kill you, Dwarf. It would be my pleasure.

KILI
Throw me a dagger! Quick!

TAURIEL
If you think I'm giving you a weapon, Dwarf, you are mistaken!

STOP

LEGOLAS
Search them!

GLOIN
Hey, give it back! That's private!

LEGOLAS
Who is this? Your brother?

GLOIN
That is my wife!

LEGOLAS
And what is this horrid creature? A Goblin Mutant?

GLOIN
That's my wee lad, Gimli!

LEGOLAS
Are the spiders dead?

TAURIEL
Yes, but more will come. They're growing bolder.

LEGOLAS
This is an ancient Elvish blade. Forged by my kin.

LEGOLAS
Where did you get this?

THORIN
It was given to me.

LEGOLAS
Not just a thief, but a liar as well.

STOP

BOFUR
Thorin, where's Bilbo?

LEGOLAS
Close the gates.

STOP

DWALIN
This is not the end of it! Do you hear me?

BIFUR
Let us out of here!

KILI
Aren't you going to search me? I could have anything down my trousers?

TAURIEL
Or nothing.

LEGOLAS
Why does that Dwarf stare at you, Tauriel?

TAURIEL
Who can say? He's quite tall for a Dwarf. Do you not think?

LEGOLAS
Taller than some.

LEGOLAS
but no less ugly.

GLOIN
Arhhg, again!

BALIN
Leave it! There is no way out! This is no Orc dungeon. These are the Halls of the Woodland realm.
No one leaves here, but, by the King's consent.

STOP

THRANDUIL
Some may imagine that a Noble quest is at hand. A Quest to reclaim a homeland and slay a dragon.
I myself, suspect a more prosaic motive. Attempted burglary, or something of that ilk.

THRANDUIL
You have found a way in. You seek that which would bestow upon you the right to rule.
A King's jewel. The Arkenstone. It is precious to you beyond measure, I understand that.
There are gems in the mountain that I too desire. White gems of pure starlight. I offer you my help.

THORIN
I am listening.

THRANDUIL
I will let you go, if you but return what is mine.

THORIN
A favor for a favor.

THRANDUIL
You have my word. One King to another.

THORIN
I would not trust, Thranduil, the great King, to only his word. Till the end of all days be upon us!
You lack all honor! I have seen how you treat your friends! We came to you once, starving, homeless;
seeking your help. But you turned your back!
You, turned away from the suffering of my people and the inferno that destroyed us!

THORIN
May you die in dragon fire!

THRANDUIL
Do not talk to me of dragon fire! I know its wrath and ruin. I have faced the great serpents of the North.

THRANDUIL
I warned your grandfather of what his greed would summon, but he would not listen.

THRANDUIL
You are just like him.

THRANDUIL
Stay here if you will, and rot. A hundred years is a mere blink in a life of an Elf. I'm patient. I can wait.

STOP

BALIN
Did he offer you a deal?

THORIN
He did. I told him he could go ishkh khakfe andu null. Him and all his kin!

BALIN
Well, that's that then. The deal was our only hope.

THORIN
It's not our only hope.

STOP

THRANDUIL
I know you're there.

THRANDUIL
Why do you linger in the shadows?

TAURIEL
I was coming to report to you.

THRANDUIL
I thought I ordered that nest to be destroyed not two moons past.

TAURIEL
We cleared the forest as ordered, my Lord. But more spiders keep coming up from the south.
They are spawning in the ruins of Dol Guldur, if we could kill them at their source-

THRANDUIL
That fortress lies beyond our borders. Keep our lands clear of those foul creatures, that is your task.

TAURIEL
And when we drive them off, what then? Will they not spread to other lands?

THRANDUIL
Other lands are not my concern. The fortunes of the world will rise and fall, but here in this kingdom, we will endure.
Legolas said you fought well today. He's grown very fond of you.

TAURIEL
I assure, my Lord, Legolas thinks of me as not more than a Captain of the Guard.

THRANDUIL
Perhaps he did once. Now I'm not so sure.

TAURIEL
I do not think that you would allow your son to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.

THRANDUIL
No, you are right, l would not. Still, he cares about you. Do not give him hope where there is none.

STOP

NARZUG
The gates are guarded.

BOLG
Not all of them. Follow me.

STOP

TAURIEL
The stone in your hand, what is it?

KILI
It is a Talisman.

KILI
A powerful spell lies upon it, if any but a dwarf reads the runes on this stone they will be forever cursed!

KILI
Or not. Depending on whether you believe in that kind of thing. It's just a token.
A Rune Stone. My mother gave me it to me so I'd remember my promise.

TAURIEL
What promise?

KILI
That I would come back to her. She worries. She thinks I'm reckless.

TAURIEL
Are you?

KILI
Nah.

KILI
Sounds like quite a party you're having up there.

TAURIEL
It is Mereth Nuin Giliath; The Feast of Starlight. All light is sacred to the Eldar, but the Wood Elves love best the light of the stars.

KILI
I always thought it is a cold light, remote and far away.

TAURIEL
It is memory, precious and pure.

TAURIEL
Like your promise.

TAURIEL
I have walked there sometimes, beyond the forest and up into the night.
I have seen the world fall away and the white light forever fill the air.

KILI
I saw a fire moon once. It rose over the pass near Dunland.
Huge! Red and gold it was, it filled the sky. We were an escort for some merchants from Ered Luin,
they were trading in silverwork for furs. We took the Greenway south, keeping the mountain to our left,
and then it appeared. This huge fire moon lighting our path. I wish I could show you-

STOP

LETHUIN
Galion, you old rogue! We're running out of drink.

ELROS
These empty barrels should have been sent to Esgaroth hours ago. The party have been waiting for them.

LETHUIN
Say what you like about our ill tempered King he has excellent taste in wine. Come, Elros, try it.

ELROS
I have the dwarves in my charge.

LETHUIN
They're locked up, where can they go?

STOP

BOFUR
I'll wager the sun in on the rise. Must be nearly dawn.

ORI
We're never gonna reach the mountain, are we?

BILBO
Not stuck in here you're not.

BALIN
Bilbo!

BILBO
Ssh! There are guards, nearby!
Not that way. Down here, follow me!

BOMBUR
Which way?

BILBO
Come on! This way. Come on!

KILI
I don't believe it, we're in the cellars!

BOFUR
You're supposed to be leading us out not further in!

BILBO
I know what I'm doing!
Okay, this way. This way.

BILBO
Everyone, climb into the barrels, quickly!

DWALIN
Are you mad? They'll find us!

BILBO
No, no. They won't! I promise you. Please, please, you must trust me!

THORIN
Do as he says!

BOFUR
What do we do now?

BILBO
Hold your breath.

BOFUR
Hold my breath? What do you mean?

STOP

TAURIEL
Where is the keeper of the keys?

STOP

THORIN
Well done, Master Baggins.

THORIN
Go, come on let's go!

BALIN
Hold on!

LEGOLAS
Shut the gate!

THORIN
No!

BOFUR
Watch out!

BOLG
Slay them all!

THORIN
Get over the bridge!

BOLG
Kill her! Kill the She-Elf!
After them!

LEGOLAS
Tauriel, wait! This one we keep alive.

BOLG
After them! Cut them off!

STOP

GANDALF
Oh, it's you.

RADAGAST
Why am I here, Gandalf?

GANDALF
Trust me, Radagast, I would not have called you here without good reason.

RADAGAST
This is not a nice place to meet.

GANDALF
No, it is not.

RADAGAST
These are dark spells, Gandalf. Old and full of hate. Who's buried here?

GANDALF
If he had a name, it's long since been lost. He would've been known only as a servant of evil. One of a number. One of nine.

RADAGAST
Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.

GANDALF
The Ringwraiths have been summoned to Dol Guldur.

RADAGAST
But it cannot be the Necromancer. A human sorcerer could not summon such evil.

GANDALF
Who said it was human? The nine only answer to one master. We've been blind, Radagast. And in our blindness, the enemy has returned. He is summoning his servants. Azog the Defiler is no ordinary hunter. He is a commander, a commander of legions. The enemy is preparing for war. It will begin in the east. His mind is set upon that mountain.

RADAGAST
Where are you going?

GANDALF
To rejoin the others.

RADAGAST
Gandalf!

GANDALF
I started this, I cannot forsake them. They are in grave danger.

RADAGAST
If what you say is true, the world is in grave danger. The power in that fortress will only grow stronger.

GANDALF
You want me to cast my friends aside.

STOP

THORIN
Anything behind us?

BALIN
Not that I can see.

BOFUR
I think we've outrun the Orcs.

THORIN
Not for long, we've lost the current.

DWALIN
We almost half drowned!

THORIN
Make for the shore!

DWALIN
Aye.

THORIN
Come on, let's go!

KILI
I'm fine, it's nothing.

THORIN
On your feet.

FILI
Kili's wounded, his leg needs binding.

THORIN
There's an Orc pack at our tail. We keep moving.

BALIN
To where?

BILBO
To the mountain, we're so close.

BALIN
A lake lies between us and that mountain, we have no way to cross it.

BILBO
So then we go around.

DWALIN
The Orcs will run us down as sure as daylight. We've no weapons to defend ourselves.

THORIN
Bind his leg, quickly. You have two minutes.

STOP

BARD
Do it again and you're dead.

BALIN
Excuse me, but you're from Lake-town, if I'm not mistaken? That barge over there, it wouldn't be available for hire by any chance?

BARD
What makes you think I would help you?

BALIN
Those boots have seen better days, as has that coat.

BALIN
No doubt you have some hungry mouths to feed? How many bairns?

BARD
A boy and two girls.

BALIN
And your wife, I imagine, she's a beauty?

BARD
Aye, she was.

BALIN
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-

DWALIN
Oh, come on, come on. Enough with the niceties.

BARD
What's your hurry?

DWALIN
What's it to you?

BARD
I would like to know who you are, and what you were doing in these lands.

BALIN
We are simple merchants from the Blue Mountains, journeying to see our kin in the Iron Hills.

BARD
Simple merchants, you say?

THORIN
We need food, supplies, weapons. Can you help us?

BARD
I know where these barrels came from.

THORIN
What of it?

BARD
I don't know what business you had with the elves, but I don't think it ended well.
No one enters Lake-town but by lead of the master. All his wealth comes from trade with the Woodland realm.
He would see you in irons before risking the wrath of king Thranduil.

BALIN
I'll wager there are ways to enter that town unseen.

BARD
Aye. But for that you would need a smuggler.

BALIN
For which we would pay double.

STOP

THRANDUIL
Such is the nature of evil. Out there in the vast ignorance of the world it festers and spreads.
A shadow that grows in the dark. A sleepless malice as black as the oncoming wall of night.
So it ever was. So will it always be. In time all foul things come forth.

LEGOLAS
You were tracking a company of thirteen dwarves. Why?

NARZUG
Not thirteen, not anymore. The young one, the blackhead archer, we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.
The poison's in his blood, he'll be choking on it soon.

TAURIEL
Answer the question, filth.

NARZUG
I do not answer to dogs, She-Elf!

LEGOLAS
I would not antagonize her.

TAURIEL
You like killing things, Orc? You like death? Then let me give it to you!

THRANDUIL
Enough! Tauriel, leave! Go now.

THRANDUIL
I do not care about one dead dwarf. Answer the question, you have nothing to fear.
Tell us what you know and I will set you free.

LEGOLAS
You had orders to kill them, why? What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

NARZUG
The Dwarf runt will never be King!

LEGOLAS
King? There is no King under the mountain, nor will there ever be.
None would dare to enter Erebor Whilst the dragon lives.

NARZUG
You know nothing. You're world will burn.

LEGOLAS
What are you talking about? Speak!

NARZUG
Your time has come again. My master serves the one.
Do you understand now, Elfling? Death is upon you. The flames of war are upon you.

LEGOLAS
Why did you do that? You promised to set him free.

THRANDUIL
And I did. I freed his wretched head from his miserable shoulders.

LEGOLAS
There was more the Orc could tell us.

THRANDUIL
There was nothing more he could tell me.

LEGOLAS
What did he mean by the flames of war?

THRANDUIL
It means they intend to unleash a weapon so great it will destroy all before it.

THRANDUIL
I want the watch doubled at our borders, all roads, all rivers. Nothing moves but I hear of No one enters this kingdom and no one leaves it.

LEGOLAS
Close the gate! Keep it sealed by order of the King.

ELROS
What about Tauriel?

LEGOLAS
What about her?

ELROS
She went into the forest armed with her bow and blade. She has not returned.

STOP

HUNTER ORC
Dwarf blood! They were here!

BOLG
There is another scent.

BOLG
Man flesh!

BOLG
They have found a way to cross the lake.

STOP

BOFUR
Watch out!

THORIN
What are you trying to do? Drown us?

BARD
I was born and bred on these waters, Master Dwarf. If I wanted to drown you, I would not do it here.

DWALIN
Oh, I've had enough of this lippy lake-man. I say we throw him over the side and be done with him.

BILBO
Oh, Bard. He's name's Bard.

DWALIN
How do you know?

BILBO
I asked him.

DWALIN
I don't care what he calls himself, I don't like him.

BALIN
We do not have to like him, we simply have to pay him.

BALIN
Come on, now, lads. Turn out your pockets.

DWALIN
How do we know he won't betray us?

THORIN
We don't.

BALIN
There's just a wee problem. We're ten coins short.

THORIN
Gloin, come on. Give us what you have.

GLOIN
Don't look to me. I have been bled dry by this venture! What have I seen for my investment? Naught but misery and grief and-

GLOIN
Bless my beard.
Take it. Take all of it.

BARD
The money, quick. Give it to me.

THORIN
We will pay you when we get our provisions, but not before.

BARD
If you value your freedom, you'll do as I say. There are guards ahead.

DWALIN
Ssh. What's he doing?

BILBO
He's talking to someone. He's pointing right at us. Now they're shaking hands.

THORIN
What?

DWALIN
He's selling us out.

STOP

BARD
Quiet! We're approaching the toll gate.

PERCY
Halt! Goods inspection. Papers please!

PERCY
Oh, it's you, Bard!

BARD
Morning, Percy.

PERCY
Anything to declare?

BARD
Nothing. But I am cold and tired, and ready for home.

PERCY
You and me both.

PERCY
There we are, all in order.

ALFRID
Not so fast.

ALFRID
Consignment of empty barrels from the Woodland realm.

ALFRID
Only they're not empty. Are they Bard? If I recall correctly, you're licensed as a bargeman. Not a fisherman.

BARD
That's none of your business.

ALFRID
Wrong. It's the Master's business, which makes it my business.

BARD
Oh, come on, Alfrid. Have a heart, people need to eat.

ALFRID
These fish are illegal.

ALFRID
Empty the barrels over the side.

BRAGA
You heard him, in the canal.

BRAGA
Come on. Get a move on.

BARD
Folk in this town are struggling. Times are hard. Food is scarce.

ALFRID
That's not my problem.

BARD
And when the people hear the Master is dumping fish back in the lake? When the rioting starts? Will it be your problem then?

ALFRID
Stop! Ever the people's champion, hey, Bard? Protector of the common folk.
You might have their favor now, bargeman, but it won't last.

PERCY
Raise the gate!

ALFRID
The Master has his eye on you. You'll do well to remember, we know where you live.

BARD
It's a small town, Alfrid. Everyone knows where everyone lives.

STOP

ALFRID
All this talk of civil unrest, someone's been stirring the pot, Sire. Gout playing out, Sire?

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
It's the damp! It's the only possible explanation. Now, get me a brandy.

ALFRID
The mood of the people, Sire, it's turning ugly.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
They're commoners, Alfrid. They've always been ugly.
It's not my fault they live in a place that stinks of fish-oil and tar.
Jobs, shelter, food. It's all they ever bleat about.

ALFRID
It's my belief, Sire. They're being led on by troublemakers.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Then we must find these troublemakers and arrest them.

ALFRID
My thoughts exactly, Sire.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
And all this talk of a change must be suppressed. We can't afford to let the rabble band together,
start making noises. The next you know, they'll start asking questions, forming committees.
Launching inquiries.

ALFRID
Out with the old, in with the new.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
What?

ALFRID
That's what they've been saying, Sire. There is even talk of an election.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
An election? That's absurd! I won't stand for it.

ALFRID
I don't think they'd ask you to stand, Sire.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Shirkers, ingrates, rabble rousers!
Who would have the nerve to question my authority? Who would dare? Who-?

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Bard. You mark my words, that trouble making bargeman is behind all this.

STOP

DWALIN
Get your hands off me.

BARD
You didn't see them, they were never here. The fish you can have for nothing.

BARD
Follow me.

BAIN
Da, our house! It's being watched.

BARD
You can tell the Master I'm done for the day.

TILDA
Da! Where have you been?

SIGRID
Father, there you are. I was worried.

BARD
Here, Sigrid.

BARD
Bain, get them in.

DWALIN
If you speak of this to anyone, I'll rip your arms off.

DWALIN
Get off.

BAIN
Up there.

SIGRID
Da, why are there dwarves coming out of our toilet?

TILDA
Will they bring us luck?

BARD
They may not be the best fit, but they'll keep you warm.

BILBO
Oh, thank you.

STOP

THORIN
The Dwarvish Wind-Lance!

BILBO
You look like you've seen a ghost.

BALIN
He has. The last time we saw such a weapon the city was on fire. It was a day the dragon came. The day that Smaug destroyed Dale.

BALIN
Girion, the lord of the city, rallied his bowmen to fire upon the beast. But a dragon's hide is tough, tougher than the strongest armor. Only a Black Arrow fired from a wind-lance could have pierced the dragon's hide. And few of those arrows were ever made.

BALIN
The store was running low when Girion made his last stand.

THORIN
If the aim of men had been true that day, much would've been different.

BARD
You speak as if you were there.

THORIN
All Dwarves know the tale.

BAIN
Then you would know that Girion hit the dragon. He loosened his scale under the left wing, one more shot and he would've killed the beast.

DWALIN
That's a fairy story, lad. Nothing more.

THORIN
You took our money. Where are the weapons?

BARD
Wait here.

STOP

THORIN
Tomorrow begins the last days of Autumn.

BALIN
Durin's Day falls the morning after next. We must reach the mountain before then.

KILI
And if we do not? If we fail to find the hidden door before that time?

FILI
Then this quest has been for nothing.

THORIN
What is this?

BARD
Pike hook. Made from an old harpoon.

KILI
And this?

BARD
A crow bill, we call it. Fashioned from a smithy's hammer. It's heavy in a hand, I grant.
But in defense of your life, these will serve you better than none.

GLOIN
We paid for weapons. Iron forged, swords and axes!

BOFUR
It's a joke!

BARD
You won't find better outside the city armory. All iron forged weapons are held there under lock and key.

BALIN
Thorin, why not take what's on offer and go. I've made do with less, so have you. I say we leave now.

BARD
You're not going anywhere.

DWALIN
What did you say?

BARD
There are spies watching this house and probably every dock and wharf in the town. We must wait till nightfall.
Thorin.

BAIN
Da?

BARD
Don't let them leave.

STOP

TAURIEL
I thought you were an Orc.

LEGOLAS
If I were an Orc you would be dead.

LEGOLAS
Tauriel, you cannot hunt thirty Orcs on your own.

TAURIEL
But I'm not on my own.

LEGOLAS
You knew I would come.

LEGOLAS
The King is angry, Tauriel. For six hundred years my father has protected you, favored you. You defied his orders, you betrayed his trust.

LEGOLAS
Come back with me, he will forgive you.

TAURIEL
But I will not. If I go back, I will not forgive myself.

TAURIEL
The King has never let Orc filth roam our lands. Yet he would let this Orc pack cross our borders and kill our prisoners.

LEGOLAS
It is not our fight.

TAURIEL
It is our fight. It will not end here. With every victory this evil will grow. If your father has his way, we will do nothing. We will hide within our walls, live our lives away from the light and let darkness descend. Are we are not part of this world? Tell me, mellon, when did we let evil become stronger than us?

STOP

STALLKEEPER
Hello, Bard. What are you after?

BARD
There was a tapestry. An old one. Where's it gone?

STALLKEEPER
What tapestry are you talking about?

BARD
This one.

LAKE-TOWN FEMALE #1
They were dwarves I tell you. Appeared out of nowhere. Full beards, fierce eyes. I've never seen the like.

LAKE-TOWN MALE #1
What are dwarves doing in these parts?

LAKE-TOWN MALE #2
It's the prophecy.

LAKE-TOWN MALE #1
Prophecy?

LAKE-TOWN MALE #2
Prophecy of Durin's folk.

BARD
A prophecy?

LAKE-TOWN MALE #3
The old tales have come true.

LAKE-TOWN FEMALE #2
Vast halls of treasure!

LAKE-TOWN FEMALE #3
Can it really be true? Has the Lord of Silver Fountains returned?

BARD
The Lord of Silver Fountains. The King of Carven Stone. The King Beneath the Mountain, shall come into his own.
And the bells shall ring in gladness at the Mountain King's return.
But all shall fade in sadness. And the lake will shine and burn.

STOP

BAIN
Da! I tried to stop them.

BARD
How long have they been gone?

STOP

DWALIN
Shh. Keep it down.

THORIN
As soon as we have the weapons, we'll make straight for the mountain.

THORIN
Go, go, go.
You alright?

KILI
I can manage. Let's just get out of here.

STOP

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
What is the meaning of this?

BRAGA
We caught 'em stealing weapons, Sire.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Ah! Enemies of the state, huh?

ALFRID
A desperate bunch of mercenaries, if ever there was, Sire.

DWALIN
Hold your tongue!

DWALIN
You do not know to whom you speak. This is no common criminal. This is Thorin. Son of Thrain, son of Thror!

THORIN
We are the dwarves of Erebor. We have come to reclaim our homeland.

THORIN
I remember this town in the great days of old. Fleets of boats lay at harbor, filled with silks and fine gems. This was no forsaken town on a lake. This was the center of all trade in the north!

THORIN
I would see those days return. I would relight the great forges of the dwarves and send wealth and riches flowing once more from the halls of Erebor!

BARD
Death! That is what you'll bring upon us.

BARD
Dragonfire and ruin. If you awaken that beast, it will destroy us all.

THORIN
You can listen to this naysayer, but I promise you this; if we succeed all will share in the wealth of the mountain.

THORIN
You will have enough gold to rebuild Esgaroth ten times over!

BARD
All of you! Listen to me, you must listen! Have you forgotten what happened to Dale?
Have you forgotten those who died in the firestorm? And for what purpose?
The blind ambition of a Mountain King, so driven by greed, he could not see beyond his own desire!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Now. Now. We must not, any of us, be too quick to lay blame. Let us not forget,
that it was Girion, Lord of Dale, your ancestor, who failed to kill the beast. Hm!

ALFRID
It's true, Sire. We all know the story. Arrow after arrow, he shot. Each one missing its mark.

BARD
You have no right. No right to enter that mountain.

THORIN
I have the only right.

THORIN
I speak to the Master of the men of the lake. Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?
Will you share in the great wealth of our people?

THORIN
What say you?

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
I say unto you: Welcome!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Welcome and rise! Welcome, King Under the Mountain!

STOP

BILBO
You do know we're one short? Where's Bofur?

THORIN
If he's not here, we leave him behind.

BALIN
We'll have to, if we're to find the door before nightfall. We can risk no more delays.

THORIN
Not you. We must travel at speed, you will slow us down.

KILI
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.

THORIN
No, no.

KILI
I'm going to be there when that door's opened. When we first look upon the halls of our fathers, Thorin-

THORIN
Kili, stay here. Rest. Join us when you're healed.

OIN
I'll stay with the lad. My duty lies with the wounded.

FILI
Uncle, we grew up on tales of the mountain. Tales you told us.
You cannot take that away from him! I will carry him if I must!

THORIN
One day you will be King and you will understand.
I cannot risk the fate of this quest for the sake of one dwarf. Not even my own kin.

THORIN
Fili, don't be a fool. You belong with the company.

FILI
I belong with my brother.

STOP

BOFUR
By my beard, is that the time!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Go now with our good will.

BOFUR
Wait!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
And may your return bring fortune to all!

BOFUR
No! Did you miss the boat as well?

FILI
Kili? Kili!

STOP

BARD
No. I'm done with dwarves, go away!

BOFUR
No! No! No one will help us. Kili's sick. He's very sick.

STOP

BILBO
What is this place?

BALIN
It was once the city of Dale. Now it is a ruin. The Desolation of Smaug.

THORIN
The sun will soon reach midday. We must find the hidden door into the mountain before it sets. This way.

BILBO
Wait. Is this the overlook? Gandalf said to meet him here, on no account were we to-

THORIN
Do you see him? We have no time to wait upon the wizard. We're on our own. Come.

STOP

GANDALF
Dol Guldur. The hill of sorcery.

RADAGAST
It looks completely abandoned.

GANDALF
As it is meant to. A spell of concealment lies over this place. Which means our enemy is not yet ready to reveal himself. He has not regained his full strength. Radagast, I need you to carry a message to the Lady Galadriel. Tell her, we must force his hand.

RADAGAST
What do you mean?

GANDALF
I'm going in alone. On no account come after me.

GANDALF
Do I have your word?

RADAGAST
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

RADAGAST
Wait, Gandalf! What if it's a trap?

GANDALF
Turn around and do not come back.

GANDALF
It's undoubtedly a trap.

GANDALF
The evil that is hidden here, I command it to come forth! I command it to reveal itself!

AZOG
The Wizard has come.

ORC
He is lifting the spell. He will find us!

AZOG
Yes, he will!

STOP

THORIN
Anything?

DWALIN
Nothing!

THORIN
If the map is true, the hidden door lies directly above us. Up here!

THORIN
You have keen eyes, Master Baggins.

THORIN
This must be it. The hidden door.
Let all those who doubted us, rue this day!

DWALIN
Hey, we have a key.

DWALIN
Which means there's somewhere there is a keyhole.

THORIN
The last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.
We're losing the light. Come on!

NORI
Be quiet. I can't hear when you're thumping!

DWALIN
I can't find it. It's not here! It's not here!

THORIN
Break it down!

THORIN
Come on!

THORIN
We lost the light.

BALIN
It's no good! The door's sealed! Can't be open by force. Powerful magic on it.

THORIN
No! The last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.

THORIN
That's what it says. What did we miss?

THORIN
What did we miss? Balin.

BALIN
We've lost the light. There's no more to be done. We had but one chance. Come away, lads. It's over.

BILBO
Wait a minute, what? Where are they going?

BILBO
You can't give up now!
Thorin. You can't give up now.

BILBO
Stand by the grey stone. When the thrush knocks, and the setting sun.
And the last light of Durin's Day will shine.

BILBO
The last light. The last light!

BILBO
The keyhole! Come back! Come back!
It's the light of the moon! The last moon of Autumn!

BILBO
Where's the key? Where's the key? Where's the-?
It was here. Come on. It was here It was just-

STOP

THORIN
Erebor. I know these walls. These halls. This stone.
You remember it, Balin. Chambers filled with golden light.

BALIN
I remember.

GLOIN
Herein lies the seventh kingdom of Durin's folk.
May the heart of the mountain unite all dwarves in defense of this home.

BALIN
The throne of the king.

BILBO
And what's that above it?

BALIN
The Arkenstone.

BILBO
The Arkenstone. And what's that?

THORIN
That, Master Burglar, is why you are here.

stopped

BOFUR
Can you not do something?

OIN
I need herbs, something to bring down his fever.

BARD
We have nightshade, feverfew-

OIN
They're no use to me. Do you have any Kingsfoil?

BARD
No, it's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.

BOFUR
Pigs?

BOFUR
Weed? Right.

BOFUR
Don't move.

STOP

BILBO
You want me to find a jewel?

BALIN
A large white jewel, yes.

BILBO
That-that's it? Only I imagine there's quite a few down there.

BALIN
There is only one Arkenstone. And you'll know it when you see it.

BILBO
Right.

BALIN
In truth, lad. I do not know what you will find down there. You needn't go if you don't want to. There's no dishonor in turning back.

BILBO
No. Balin, I promised I would do this. And I think I must try.

BALIN
It never ceases to amaze me.

BILBO
What's that?

BALIN
The courage of hobbits. Go now, with as much luck as you can muster.

BALIN
Oh, and, Bilbo.

BILBO
Mm?

BALIN
If there is in fact a- a live dragon down there: Don't waken it.

STOP

AZOG
You have come too late, Wizard! It is done.

GANDALF
Where is your master? Where is he?

AZOG
He is everywhere. We are legion!

AZOG
It is over.

AZOG
Run him down!

THE NECROMANCER
There is no light, Wizard, that can defeat darkness.

GANDALF
Sauron.

STOP

BILBO
Hello? He's not at home. Not at home. Good. Good, good, good.

BILBO
Arkenstone. Arkenstone. A large, white jewel. Very helpful.

SMAUG
Well, thief-

SMAUG
I smell you. I hear your breath. I feel your air. Where are you? Where are you?
Come, now. Don't be shy. Step into the light.

SMAUG
Mm. There is something about you. Something you carry. Something made of gold. But far more - precious.

SMAUG
There you are, thief in the shadows.

BILBO
I did not come to steal from you, oh Smaug, the unaccessibly wealthy.
I merely wanted to gaze upon your magnificence.
To see if you really were as great as the old tales say. I did not believe them.

SMAUG
And do you now?

BILBO
Truly. The tales and songs fall utterly short of your enormity, oh Smaug, the stupendous.

SMAUG
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

BILBO
No. No.

SMAUG
No indeed. You seem familiar with my name. But I don't remember smelling your kind before.
Who are you and where do you come from, may I ask?

BILBO
I come from under the hill.

SMAUG
Underhill?

BILBO
And under hills and over hills my path has led. And and through the air, I am he who walks unseen.

SMAUG
Impressive, what else do you claim to be?

BILBO
I am luck wearer, r-riddle maker.

SMAUG
Lovely titles. Go on.

BILBO
Barrel rider.

SMAUG
Barrels? Now that is interesting. And what about your little dwarf friends? Where are they hiding?

BILBO
Dwarves? No. No, no. No dwarves here. You've got that all wrong.

SMAUG
Oh, I don't think so, barrel rider. They sent you in here to do their dirty work while they skulk about outside.

BILBO
Truly, you are mistaken, oh Smaug, chiefest and greatest of calamities.

SMAUG
You have nice manners for a thief and a liar. I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.
No one better. It is the gold, they are drawn to treasure like flies to dead flesh.

SMAUG
Did you think I did not know this day would come? That a pack of canting dwarves would come crawling back to the mountain.

STOP

ORI
Was that an earthquake?

BALIN
That, my lad, was a dragon.

STOP

SIGRID
Da?

BAIN
It's coming from the mountain.

FILI
You should leave us. Take your children and get out of here.

BARD
And go where? There is nowhere to go.

TILDA
Are we going to die, Da?

BARD
No, darling.

TILDA
The dragon, it's going to kill us.

BARD
Not if I kill it first.

Stop

SMAUG
The King Under the Mountain is dead. I took his throne, I ate his people like a wolf among sheep.

SMAUG
I kill where I wish, when I wish. My armor is iron. No blade can pierce me!

STOP

BARD
Alright.

BAIN
A Black Arrow. Why did you never tell me?

BARD
Because you did not need to know.

BARD
Listen to me carefully, I need you to distract the guards.
Once I'm at the top of the tower, I'll slip the arrow to the bow.

LAKE-TOWN GUARD
There he is! Guards, after him!

BARD
Quickly! Down there! Go!

LAKE-TOWN GUARD
Stop him!

BARD
Bain! Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find it.

BAIN
No.

BARD
I'll deal with them!

BAIN
I'm not leaving!

BARD
Go!

BARD
Braga.

BRAGA
You're under arrest.

BARD
On what charge?

BRAGA
Any charge the Master chooses.

STOP

ORI
What about Bilbo?

THORIN
Give him more time.

BALIN
Time to do what? To be killed?

THORIN
You're afraid.

BALIN
Yes, I'm afraid. I fear for you. A sickness lies upon that treasure horde.
A sickness which drove your grandfather mad.

THORIN
I am not my grandfather.

BALIN
You're not yourself. The Thorin I know would not hesitate to go in there.

THORIN
I will not risk this quest for the life of one burglar.

BALIN
Bilbo. His name is Bilbo.

STOP

SMAUG
It's Oakenshield. That filthy dwarvish usurper. He sent you in here for the Arkenstone, didn't he?

BILBO
No! No, no, no. I don't know what you're talking about.

SMAUG
Don't bother denying it. I guessed his foul purpose some time ago. But it matters not. Oakenshield's quest will fail. A darkness is coming. It will spread to every corner of the land.

SMAUG
You are being used, thief in the shadows. You were only ever a means to an end. The coward Oakenshield has weighed the value of your life and found it worth nothing.

BILBO
No. No, you're lying.

SMAUG
What did he promise you? A share of the treasure? As if it was his to give. I will not part with a single coin. Not one piece of it!

SMAUG
My teeth are swords, my claws are spears. My wings are a hurricane!

BILBO
So it is true. The Black Arrow found its mark.

SMAUG
What did you say?

BILBO
I was just saying, your reputation precedes you, oh Smaug, the tyrannical. Truly, you have no equal on this earth.

SMAUG
I am almost tempted to let you take it, if only to see Oakenshield suffer.
Watch it destroy him, watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad.
But I think not, I think our little game ends here. So tell me, thief. How do you choose to die?

STOP

SIGRID
Da? Is that you, Da?

ORC
Oakenshield has gone!

BOLG
Fall back! Regroup at the bridge!

BAIN
You killed them all.

LEGOLAS
There are others. Tauriel, come.

OIN
We're losing him!

BOFUR
What are you doing?

TAURIEL
I'm going to save him.

STOP

THORIN
You're alive.

BILBO
Not for much longer.

THORIN
Did you find the Arkenstone?

BILBO
The dragon's coming!

THORIN
The Arkenstone? Did you find it?

BILBO
No, we have to get out.

SMAUG
You will burn!

THORIN
Come on!

BALIN
Come on, Bilbo!

THORIN
Come on.

STOP

TAURIEL
Hold him down.

SIGRID
Tilda!

STOP

THORIN
Ssh. Ssh-ssh.

DORI
We've given him the slip.

DWALIN
No, he's too cunning for that.

BILBO
So where to now?

THORIN
The western guard room. There may be a way out.

BALIN
It's too high. There's no chance that way.

THORIN
It's our only chance. We'll have to try.

THORIN
Come on.

STOP

OIN
I've heard tale of the wonders of elvish medicine. That was a privilege to witness.

KILI
Tauriel.

TAURIEL
Lie still.

KILI
You cannot be her. She is far away. She is far, far away from me.
She walks in starlight in another world. It was just a dream.

KILI
Do you think she could've loved me?

STOP

THORIN
Stay close.

DWALIN
That's it then. There's no way out.

BALIN
The last of our kin. They must've come here, hoping beyond hope.

BALIN
We could try to reach the mines. We might last a few days.

THORIN
No. I will not die like this. Cowering, clawing for breath.

THORIN
We make for the forges.

DWALIN
He'll see us, sure as death.

THORIN
Not if we split up.

BALIN
Thorin, we'll never make it.

THORIN
Some of us might. Lead him to the forges. We kill the dragon. If this is to end in fire, then we will all burn together.

THORIN
This way!

SMAUG
Flee! Flee! Run for your lives! There is nowhere to hide.

ORI
Behind you!

DORI
Come on!

DORI
Run!

DWALIN
Hey, you! Here!

STOP

BOLG
Send word to Dol Guldur, Oakenshield has reached the Mountain!

BOLG
Go. You! Come with me.

STOP

BALIN
This way! It's this way! Come on!

THORIN
Follow Balin!

BALIN
Come on!

DWALIN
Thorin! Hold on! The plan's not gonna work.
These furnaces are stone cold.

BALIN
He's right. We've no fire hot enough to set them ablaze.

THORIN
Have we not?

STOP

THORIN
I did not look to see you so easily outwitted!
You have grown slow and fat in your dotage. Slug!

THORIN
Take cover. Go!

THORIN
Bombur! Get those billows working! Go!
Bilbo! Up there. On my mark, pull that lever.

THORIN
Balin, can you still mix a flash flame?

BALIN
Aye, it will only take a jiffy!

BALIN
Come on!

DWALIN
We don't have a jiffy.

DORI
Where's the sulfur? Are you sure you know what you're doing? Come on!

THORIN
Now!

THORIN
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings.

THORIN
Keep going, Bilbo! Run!

SMAUG
You think you can deceive me, barrel rider? You have come from Lake-town.
This is some sordid scheme hatched between these filthy dwarves and those miserable trading lakemen.
Those sniveling cowards with their long bows and black arrows. Perhaps it is time I paid them a visit.

BILBO
Oh no!

BILBO
This isn't their fault! Wait! You cannot go to Lake-town!

SMAUG
You care about them, do you? Good. Then you can watch them die!

THORIN
Here! You witless worm!

SMAUG
You.

THORIN
I am taking back what you stole.

SMAUG
You will take nothing from me, Dwarf. I laid low your warriors of old.
I instill terror in the hearts of men. I am King Under the Mountain.

THORIN
This is not your kingdom. These are Dwarf lands. This is Dwarf gold. And we will have our revenge.

SMAUG
Ah, revenge! Revenge! I will show you revenge!

BARD
Listen to me! Do you not know what is coming?

SMAUG
I am fire. I am - death!

BILBO
What have we done?

STOP

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
I warned you! Did I not warn you what would come of dealing with Dwarves? Now they've done it! They've woken the dragon;
they've brought the apocalypse upon our heads! Come on, quickly, quickly! Faster now, I'm trying to evacuate myself here!
Careful with that. Never mind the books! Get on, get the rest of it.

ALFRID
But, Sire, should we not try to save the town?

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
The town is lost, save the gold!

LAKE-TOWNER
Pile 'em up!

TAURIEL
We have no time, we must leave.

STOP

FILI
Get him up.

FILI
Come on, brother. Come on, come on, let's go.

KILI
I'm fine, I can walk.

TAURIEL
As fast as you can.

BAIN
We're not leaving, not without our father.

TAURIEL
If you stay here, your sisters will die. Is that what your father would want?

BARD
Open this door! Do you hear me!

BOFUR
Down here, now!

OIN
Give me your hand.

BOFUR
Come on, we gotta go!

TAURIEL
Quickly now, hurry!

FILI
Kili, come on!

STOP

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Come on! Come On! Faster! Faster!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
If only we could take more of these poor people with us. But they're hardly worth it.

ALFRID
I quite agree.

BOFUR
Look out!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Move it! Move it! Come on! Faster!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
My gold! My gold!

ALFRID
We carry too much weight. We need to dump something.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Quite right, Alfrid. Faster, faster!

STOP

BALIN
Poor souls.

KILI
He hit it! He hit the dragon!

TAURIEL
No.

KILI
He did, he hit its mark, I saw!

TAURIEL
These arrows cannot pierce its hide. I fear nothing will.

BOFUR
What are you doing?

FILI
Come back! Bain! Come back! Come back here!

TAURIEL
Leave him! We cannot go back.

STOP

BARD
Bain! What are you doing? Why didn't you leave? You were supposed to leave!

BAIN
I came to help you.

BARD
No! Nothing can stop it now.

BAIN
This might.

BARD
Bain, you go back. You get out of here now.

STOP

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Stop, stop! Halt! Halt!

SMAUG
Who are you that would stand against me?

SMAUG
Now that is a pity. What will you do now, bowman? You are forsaken. No help will come.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Now's our chance! Go now! Head to the open water!

SMAUG
Hmm. Is that your child? You cannot save him from the fire. He will burn!

BARD
Stay still, son. Stay still.

SMAUG
Tell me, wretch, how now shall you challenge me?

SMAUG
You have nothing left but your death!

BARD
Bain. Look at me. You look at me. A little to your left.

BARD
That's it.

BARD
Bain! Hold on!

STOP

ORI
What was that? What happened?

BILBO BAGGINS
It fell, I saw it. It's dead.

BILBO BAGGINS
Smaug is dead.

GLOIN
By my beard, I think he's right!

GLOIN
Look there! The Ravens of Erebor are returning to the Mountain.

BALIN
Aye, word will spread. Before long, every soul in Middle Earth will know the Dragon is dead!

STOP

LAKE-TOWNER
Will somebody help me! Don't let me go.

ALFRID
Help! Ahh! Why me?

FILI
Kili, come on. We're leaving.

TAURIEL
They are your people, you must go.

KILI
Come with me. I know how I feel, I'm not afraid. You make me feel alive.

TAURIEL
No, I can't.

KILI
Tauriel. Amrâlimê.

TAURIEL
I don't know what that means.

KILI
I think you do.

TAURIEL
My Lord Legolas.

LEGOLAS
Take your leave of the Dwarf. You are needed elsewhere.

KILI
Keep it, as a promise.

STOP

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
These are dry. You'll need them.

LAKE-TOWN REFUGEE
Thank you.

ALFRID
Oi! Give me one of them. I'll take my death in this cold!

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
Oh, find your own! You're not in charge now, Alfrid Lickspittle.

ALFRID
That is where you are wrong. In the absence of the Master the powers seethes to his deputy,
which in this instance is my good self. Now give me that blanket!

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
Master's Deputy? Don't make me laugh. You're a sneak thief, more like.
I'll be dead before I answer to the likes of you.

ALFRID
Maybe that can be arranged.

BARD
I wouldn't go turning on your own, Alfrid. Not now.

TILDA
Da!

BARD
Come here.

SIGRID
You're alive!

BARD
It's alright.

LAKE-TOWN MAN
It was Bard! He killed the dragon! I saw it with me own eyes. He brought the beast down. Struck him dead with a Black Arrow!

LAKE-TOWNER
You've saved us all, bless you.

ALFRID
All hail to the Dragon-slayer! All hail King Bard!
I have said it many times, this is a man of noble stock. A born leader.

BARD
Do not call me that. I'm not the Master of this town.

BARD
Where is he? Where's the master?

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
Half way down the Anduin, with all our coin, I don't doubt.

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
You would know. You helped him empty the treasury.

ALFRID
No. I tried to stop him.

LAKE-TOWNER #1
Liar!

LAKE-TOWNER #2
Thief!

LAKE-TOWNER #3
You're a mongrel!

ALFRID
I begged, I pleaded-

LAKE-TOWNER #4
Do away with him!

ALFRID
I said:"Master, no!"

ALFRID
Think of the children.
Will nobody think of the children?

LAKE-TOWNER #1
Hang him!

LAKE-TOWNER #5
To the tree with him!

BARD
Enough, Let him go! Let him go!
Look around you! Have you not had your fill of death?

BARD
Winter is upon us. We must look to our own, to the sick and the helpless.
Those who can stand, tend to the wounded, and those who have strength left, follow me.
We must salvage what we can.

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
And what then? What do we do then?

BARD
We find shelter.

STOP

BOFUR
Hello! Bombur? Bifur? Anybody?

BILBO BAGGINS
Wait! Wait!

BOFUR
It's Bilbo. He's alive!

BILBO BAGGINS
Stop! Stop! Stop! You need to leave. We all need to leave.

BOFUR
We only just got here.

BILBO BAGGINS
I tried talking to him, but he won't listen.

OIN
What do you mean, laddie?

BILBO BAGGINS
Thorin! Thorin. Thorin, he's been down there for days. He doesn't sleep, he barely eats.
He's not been himself, not at all. It's this place. I think a sickness lies upon it.

KILI
A sickness? What kind of sickness?

BILBO BAGGINS
Fili? Fili!

STOP

THORIN
Gold. Gold beyond measure, beyond sorrow and grieve.

THORIN
Behold, the great treasure hoard of Thrór.

THORIN
Welcome, my sister's sons, to the Kingdom of Erebor.

BOMBUR
You're alive!

THORIN
Any sign of it?

BIFUR
Nothing here.

ORI
Nothing here.

THORIN
Keep searching!
That jewel could be anywhere.

THORIN
The Arkenstone is in these halls. Find it!

DWALIN
You heard him, keep looking.

THORIN
All of you! No one rests until it is found!

STOP

BARD
Take only what you need, we have a long march ahead.

LEGOLAS
Where will you go?

BARD
There is only one place.

ALFRID
The Mountain? You are a genius, Sire. We can take refuge inside the Mountain.
It might smell a bit of dragon, but the women could clean that up.
It's be safe and warm and dry, and full of stores, bedding and clothing, the odd bit of gold.

BARD
What gold is in that Mountain is cursed. We will take only what was promised to us, only what we need to rebuild our lives.

ALFRID
Here, pull your weight.

LEGOLAS
News of the death of Smaug will have spread through the lands.

BARD
Aye.

LEGOLAS
Others will now look to the Mountain for its wealth or its position.

BARD
What is it you know?

LEGOLAS
Nothing for certain. It's what I fear may come.

STOP

BOLG
Woodland Elves! The King's son and a She-elf, they tracked us to Lake-town.

AZOG
And you killed them?

BOLG
They fled, squealing like cowards.

AZOG
You fool! They will return with an Army of Elves at their backs! Ride to Gundabad. Let the Legions come forth.

AZOG
Elves! Men! Dwarves! The Mountain will be their tomb! To war!

STOP

TAURIEL
You saw something out there?

LEGOLAS
The Orc I pursued out of Lake-town, I know who he is. Bolg, the spawn of Azog the Defiler. A Wargpack was waiting for him on the outskirts of Esgorath. They fled into the north. These Orcs were different from the others, they bore a mark I had not seen for a long time. The mark of Gundabad.

TAURIEL
Gundabad?

LEGOLAS
An Orc stronghold in the far north of the Misty Mountains.

FEREN
My Lord Legolas. I bring word from your Father. You are to return to him immediately.

LEGOLAS
Come, Tauriel.

FEREN
My Lord- Tauriel is banished.

LEGOLAS
Banished?

LEGOLAS
You may tell my father if there is no place for Tauriel, there is no place for me.

TAURIEL
Legolas, it is your King's command.

LEGOLAS
Yes, he is my King, but he does not command my heart.

LEGOLAS
I ride north. Will you come with me?

TAURIEL
To where?

LEGOLAS
To Gundabad.

Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky. Seven for the Dwarv-lords in their halls of stone.

Nine for mortal men doomed to die.

I am not alone.

Are you in need of assistance, My Lady?

You should have stayed dead!

GALADRIEL
Mithrandir, come back.

GANDALF
He - is here.

GALADRIEL
Yes. The darkness has returned.

Gandalf! Gandalf, climb on!

GALADRIEL
He is weak. He cannot remain here, it is straining his life.

GALADRIEL
Go, quickly!

GANDALF
Come with me, My Lady.

GALADRIEL
Go!

NECROMANCER
It has begun. The East will fall. So shall the Kingdom of Angmar rise.
The time of the Elves is over. The Age of the Orc has come.

GALADRIEL
You have no power here, servant of Mordor. You are nameless, faceless, formless!
Go back to the void from whence you came!

ELROND
We were deceived.

GALADRIEL
The spirit of Sauron endured.

SARUMAN
And has been banished.

GALADRIEL
He will flee into the East.

ELROND
Gondor should be warned. They must set a watch on the walls of Mordor.

SARUMAN
No. Look after the Lady Galadriel. She has spent much of her powers, her strength is failing. Take her to Lothlórien.

ELROND
My Lord Saruman, he must be hunted down and destroyed, once and for all.

SARUMAN
Without the Ring of Power, Sauron can never again hold dominion over Middle Earth. Go now. Leave Sauron to me.

GANDALF
I need a horse.

RADAGAST
What? Gandalf, where are you going?

GANDALF
To warn Erebor. They have no idea what is coming. I saw them with my own eyes. Rank upon rank of Moria Orcs.
You must summon our friends, bird and beast. The battle for the Mountain is about to begin.

STOP

THORIN
It is here in these halls, I know it.

DWALIN
We have searched and searched.

THORIN
Not well enough.

DWALIN
Thorin, we all would see the stone returned.

THORIN
And yet it's still not found!

BALIN
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here?

BALIN
The Arkenstone is the birthright of our people.

THORIN
It is the King's jewel. Am I not the King?!

THORIN
Know this, if anyone should find it and withhold it from me, I will be avenged.

BALIN
Dragon sickness. I've seen it before. That look, the terrible need. It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo. It sent his grandfather mad.

BILBO BAGGINS
Balin, if Thorin had the Arkenstone. Well, if it was found, would it help?

BALIN
That stone crowns all. It's the summit of this great wealth, bestowing power upon he who bears it.
But stay his madness? No, lad. I fear it would make him worse. Perhaps it is best it remains lost.

STOP

THORIN
What is that? In your hand.

BILBO BAGGINS
It's nothing.

THORIN
Show me.

BILBO BAGGINS
It- I picked it up in Beorn's garden.

THORIN
You've carried it all this way?

BILBO BAGGINS
I'm going to plant it in my garden. In Bag End.

THORIN
It's a poor prize to take back to the Shire.

BILBO BAGGINS
One day it'll grow, and every time I look at it, I'll remember. Remember everything that happened:
the good, the bad and how lucky I am that I made it home.

BILBO BAGGINS
Thorin, I-

DWALIN
Thorin, the survivors from Lake-town, they're streaming into Dale. There's hundreds of them.

THORIN
Call everyone to the gate.

THORIN
To the gate. Now!

STOP

BARD
Come on, keep moving.

ALFRID
Sire! Sire! Up here!

ALFRID
Look Sire! The braziers are lit.

BARD
So, the company of Thorin Oakenshield survived.

ALFRID
Survived? You mean there's a bunch of Dwarves in there with all that gold?

BARD
I shouldn't worry, Alfrid. There's gold enough in that Mountain for all.

BARD
Make camp here tonight. Find what shelter you can. Get some fires going.

LAKE-TOWNER
Come on, hurry along now.

BARD
Alfrid, you take the night watch.

STOP

THORIN
I want this Fortress made safe by sun-up. This Mountain was hard-won, I will not see it taken again.

KILI
The people of Lake-town have nothing. They came to us in need. They have lost everything.

THORIN
Do not tell me what they have lost. I know well enough of hardship.
Those who've lived through dragon fire should rejoice! They have much to be grateful for.

THORIN
More stone! Bring more stone to the gate!

STOP

PERCY
These children are starving. We need food. We won't last three days. Bard, we don't have enough.

BARD
Do what you can, Percy.

PERCY
It will be all right, don't worry.

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
We need more water.

BARD
The children, the wounded and the women come first.

BARD
Morning, Alfrid. What news from the night watch?

ALFRID
All quiet, Sire. Not much to report. Nothing gets past me.

BARD
Except an army of Elves, it would seem.

BARD
My Lord Thranduil, we did not look to see you here.

THRANDUIL
I heard you needed aid.

BARD
You have saved us. I do not know how to thank you.

THRANDUIL
Your gratitude is misplaced. I did not come on your behalf. I came to reclaim something of mine.
There are gems in the Mountain that I too desire. White gems of pure starlight.

THORIN
The White gems of Lasgalen. I know an Elf-lord who will pay a pretty price for these.

BARD
Wait! Please, wait! You will go to war over a handful of gems?

THRANDUIL
The heirlooms of my people are not lightly forsaken.

BARD
We are allies in this. My people also have claim upon the riches in that Mountain. Let me speak with Thorin.

THRANDUIL
You would try to reason with the Dwarf.

BARD
To avoid war? Yes.

STOP

THORIN
Nice going lads, nice work. Come on!

BARD
Hail Thorin, son of Thrain. We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.

THORIN
Why do you come to gates of the King under the Mountain armed for war?

BARD
Why does the King under the Mountain fence himself in like a robber in his hole?

THORIN
Perhaps it is because I'm expecting to be robbed.

BARD
My Lord, we have not come to rob you, but to seek fair settlement. Will you not speak with me?

THORIN
I'm listening.

BARD
On behalf of the people of Lake-town, I ask that you honor your pledge. A share of the treasure, so that they might rebuild their lives.

THORIN
I will not treat with any man, while an armed host lies before my door.

BARD
That armed host will attack this mountain if we do not come to terms.

THORIN
And your threats do not sway me.

BARD
What of your conscience?

THORIN
Does it not tell you our cause is just? My people offered you help and in return you brought upon them only ruin and death.

BARD
When did the men of Lake-town come to our aid but for the promise of rich reward. A bargain was struck!

THORIN
A bargain? What choice did we have but to barter our birthright for blankets and food. To ransom our future in exchange for our freedom. You call that a fair trade? Tell me, Bard the dragon-slayer, why should I honor such terms?

BARD
Because you gave us your word. Does that mean nothing?

THORIN
Begone! Ere our arrows fly!

BILBO BAGGINS
What are you doing? You cannot go to war.

THORIN
This does not concern you.

BILBO BAGGINS
Excuse me, but just in case you haven't noticed, there is an army of Elves out there.
Not to mention several hundred angry fishermen. We are in fact outnumbered.

THORIN
Not for much longer.

BILBO BAGGINS
What does that mean?

THORIN
It means, Master Baggins, you should never underestimate Dwarves. We have reclaimed Erebor. Now we defend it.

STOP

BARD
He will give us nothing.

THRANDUIL
Such a pity. But still you tried.

BARD
I do not understand. Why? Why would he risk war?

THRANDUIL
It is fruitless to reason with them. They understand only one thing.

THRANDUIL
We attack at dawn.

THRANDUIL
Are you with us?

STOP

THORIN
Master Baggins, come here. You're going to need this. Put it on.

THORIN
This vest is made of silver steel. Mithril it was called by my forebears. No blade can pierce it.

BILBO BAGGINS
I look absurd. I'm not a warrior, I'm a Hobbit.

THORIN
It is a gift, a token of our friendship. True friends are hard to come by.

THORIN
I have been blind, but now I'm beginning to see. I am betrayed!

BILBO BAGGINS
Betrayed?

THORIN
The Arkenstone- one of them has taken it. One of them is false.

BILBO BAGGINS
Thorin, the quest is fulfilled, you've won the Mountain. Is that not enough?

THORIN
Betrayed by my own kin.

BILBO BAGGINS
No, you made a promise to the people of Lake-town.
Now is this treasure truly worth more than your honor?nOur honor, Thorin. I was also there, I gave my word.

THORIN
For that, I'm grateful. It was nobly done.
But the treasure in this Mountain does not belong to the people of Lake-town. This gold is ours, and ours alone.

THORIN
With my life I will not part with a single coin. Not one piece of it.

STOP

TAURIEL
Gundabad. What lies beyond?

LEGOLAS
An old enemy. The ancient Kingdom of Angmar. And this fortress was once its stronghold.
It is where they kept their great armories, forged their weapons of war.

TAURIEL
A light. I saw movement.

LEGOLAS
We wait for the cover of night. It is a fell place, Tauriel. In another age our people waged war on those lands.

LEGOLAS
My mother died there. My father does not speak of it. There is no grave, no memory, nothing.

STOP

GANDALF
Let me through! Make way!

ALFRID
No, no, no! Oi, you! Pointy hat! Yes, you. We don't want no tramps, beggars nor vagabonds around here.
We've got enough trouble without the likes of you. Off you go. On your horse.

GANDALF
Who's in charge here?

BARD
Who is asking?

GANDALF
You must set aside your petty grievances with the Dwarves. War is coming.
The cesspits of Dol Guldur have been emptied. You're all in mortal danger.

BARD
What are you talking about?

THRANDUIL
I can see you know nothing of wizards. They are like winter thunder on a wild wind,
rolling in from a distance breaking hard in alarm. But sometimes a storm is just a storm.

GANDALF
Not this time. Armies of Orcs are on the move. These are fighters,
they have been bred for war. Our enemy has summoned his full strength.

THRANDUIL
Why show his hand now?

GANDALF
Because we forced him. We forced him when the company of Thorin Oakenshield set out to reclaim their homeland.
The Dwarves were never meant to reach Erebor, Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them. His master seeks control of the Mountain,
not just for the treasure within, but for where it lies, its strategic position.
This is the gateway to reclaiming the lands of Angmar in the North. If that fell Kingdom should rise again Rivendell,
Lórien, the Shire even Gondor itself will fall.

THRANDUIL
These Orc armies you speak of, Mithrandir, where are they?

STOP

RAGASH
Our army will be in position by dawn. The attack will be sudden and swift!

AZOG
The fools! They have forgotten what lives beneath these lands. They have forgotten the great Earth-eaters.

STOP

TAURIEL
If we are going in we should move now.

TAURIEL
They are swarming.

LEGOLAS
These bats are bred for one purpose.

TAURIEL
For what?

LEGOLAS
For war.

TAURIEL
We must warn the others.

LEGOLAS
We may be too late – hurry!

STOP

GANDALF
Since when has my council counted for so little? What do you think I'm trying to do?

THRANDUIL
I think you're trying to save your Dwarvish friends. And I admire your loyalty to them.
But it does not dissuade me from my cause. You started this, Mithrandir, you will forgive me if I finish it.

THRANDUIL
Are the archers in position?

ELF
Yes, My Lord.

THRANDUIL
Give the order. If anything moves on that mountain, kill it. The Dwarves are out of time.

GANDALF
You, bowman! Do you agree with this? Is gold so important to you? Would you buy it with the blood of Dwarves?

BARD
It will not come to that. This is a fight they cannot win.

BILBO BAGGINS
That won't stop them. You think the Dwarves will surrender? They won't. They will fight to the death to defend their own.

GANDALF
Bilbo Baggins!

THRANDUIL
If I'm not mistaken, this is the Halfling who stole the keys to my dungeons from under the nose of my guards.

BILBO BAGGINS
Yes. Sorry about that. I came to give you this.

THRANDUIL
The Heart of the Mountain. The King's jewel.

BARD
And worth a king's ransom. How is this yours to give?

BILBO BAGGINS
I took it as my fourteenth share of the treasure.

BARD
Why would you do this? You owe us no loyalty.

BILBO BAGGINS
I'm not doing it for you. I know that Dwarves can be obstinate and pigheaded and difficult.
And suspicious and secretive with the worst manners you can possibly imagine,
but they are also brave and kind and loyal to a fault. I've grown very fond of them, and I would save them if I can.
But Thorin values this stone above all else. In exchange for its return, I believe he will give you what you were owed.
There will be no need for war.

GANDALF
Rest up tonight. You must leave on the morrow.

BILBO BAGGINS
What?

GANDALF
Get as far away from here as possible.

BILBO BAGGINS
I'm not leaving.

GANDALF
Oh?

BILBO BAGGINS
You picked me as the fourteenth man. I'm not about to leave the company now.

GANDALF
There is no company, not any more. And I don't like to think what Thorin would do when he finds out what you've done.

BILBO BAGGINS
I'm not afraid of Thorin.

GANDALF
Well, you should be. Don't underestimate the evil of gold. Gold over which a serpent had long brooded.
Dragon-sickness seeps into the hearts of all who came to this Mountain. Almost all.

GANDALF
You there! Find this Hobbit a bed and fill his belly with hot food. He's earned it.

GANDALF
Hey. Keep an eye on him. If he should try to leave, you tell me.

ALFRID
Move it. Stupid Hobbit.

STOP

ALFRID
Wakey, wakey, Hobbit. Up you - get?

STOP

THORIN
I will put the next one between your eyes.

THRANDUIL
We've come to tell you payment of your debt has been offered and accepted.

THORIN
What payment? I gave you nothing. You have nothing.

BARD
We have this.

KILI
They have the Arkenstone. Thieves! How came you by the heirloom of our house? That stone belongs to the king.

BARD
The King may have it, with our good will.

BARD
But first he must honor his word.

THORIN
They're taking us for fools. This is a ruse, and a filthy lie. The Arkenstone is in this Mountain, it is a trick!

BILBO BAGGINS
It's no trick. The stone is real. I gave it to them.

THORIN
You?

BILBO BAGGINS
I took it as my fourteenth share.

THORIN
You would steel from me?

BILBO BAGGINS
Steel from you? No, no. I may be a burglar, but I like to think I'm an honest one.
I'm willing to let it stand against my claim.

THORIN
Against your claim?

THORIN
Your claim? You have no claim over me, you miserable rat!

BILBO BAGGINS
I was going to give it to you. Many times I wanted to, but-

THORIN
But what, thief?

BILBO BAGGINS
You are changed, Thorin. The Dwarf I met in Bag End would never have gone back on his word,
would never have doubted the loyalty of his kin.

THORIN
Do not speak to me of loyalty. Throw him from the rampart!

THORIN
Did you not hear me?! I will do it myself.

THORIN
I curse you!

FILI
No!

THORIN
Cursed be the wizard that forced you on this company!

GANDALF
If you don't like my burglar, then please don't damage him. Return him to me. You're not making a very splendid figure as King under the Mountain, are you, Thorin, son of Thrain?

THORIN
Never again will I have dealings with wizards!

BOFUR
Go.

THORIN
Or Shire rats!

BARD
Are we resolved? The return of the Arkenstone for what was promised.

BARD
Give us your answer. Will you have peace or war?

THORIN
I will have war.

GANDALF
Ironfoot.

DWARVES
Dain! Dain! Dain!

BILBO BAGGINS
Who is that? He doesn't look very happy.

GANDALF
It is Dain, Lord of the Iron Hills. Thorin's cousin.

BILBO BAGGINS
Are they alike?

GANDALF
I've always found Thorin the more reasonable of the two.

STOP

DAIN
Good morning! How are we all? I have a wee proposition,
if you wouldn't mind giving me a few moments of your time. Would you consider-

DAIN
Just sodding off?!

DAIN
All of you! Right now!

BARD
Stand fast!

GANDALF
Come now, Lord Dain.

DAIN
Gandalf the Grey. Tell this rabble to leave, or I'll water the ground with their blood.

GANDALF
There is no need for war between Dwarves, Men and Elves. A legion of Orcs march on the Mountain. Stand your army down.

DAIN
I will not stand down before any Elf. Not least this faithless woodland sprite. He wishes nothing but ill upon my people.
If he chooses to stand between me and my kin, I'll split his pretty head open! See if he's still smirking then.

DWARVES
Dain!

THRANDUIL
He's clearly mad, like his cousin.

DAIN
You hear that, lads? We're on! Let's give these bastards a good hammering!

STOP

GANDALF
Were-worms!

DAIN
Oh, come on!

AZOG
Come forth my Armies!

DAIN
The Hordes of Hell are upon us! To battle! To battle, sons of Durin!

STOP

KILI
I'm going over the wall, who's coming with me?

DWARVES
Aye! Yes!

FILI
Come on, let's go.

THORIN
Stand down.

FILI
What? Are we to do nothing?

THORIN
I said stand down!

STOP

BILBO BAGGINS
The Elves, will they not fight?

GANDALF
Thranduil! This is madness!

BILBO BAGGINS
Uh, Gandalf, is this a good place to stand?

STOP

AZOG
Send in the War Beasts!

AZOG
They cannot fight on two fronts. Now we make our move. Attack the city!

GANDALF
Azog. He's trying to cut us off.

BARD
All of you, fall back to Dale! Now!

GANDALF
To the city! People, this way!

STOP

BAIN
Sigrid! Tilda! My children! Where are my children?

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
I saw them, they were down in the Old Market!

BARD
The Market? Where are they now? Tilda! Sigrid!

PERCY
Bard, Orcs are storming over the Causeway.

BARD
Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet. Hold them of for as long as you can.

PERCY
Archers, this way!

LAKE-TOWNER MALE
The Orcs have taken Stone Street, the Market's overrun!

BARD
The rest of you, follow me!

ALFRID
Charge! Onward! To the death!

SIGRID
Over here!

TILDA
Da we're here!

BARD
Tilda! Bain! Sigrid! Get down!

BARD
Listen, I need you to gather the women and children, take them to the Great Hall and barricade the door.
You understand? You must not come out for any reason.

TILDA
We want to stay with you.

ALFRID
Show your father some respect. You leave it to me, Sire.

ALFRID
You heard him, we make to the Great Hall.

BARD
Alfrid, women and children only. I need every man fighting. See that you return.

ALFRID
I'll get them to safety, Sire. Then my sword is yours to command.

ALFRID
Get up!

BARD
Look after them.

BAIN
I will.

ALFRID
Shift it, granny.

BAIN
Make for the Great Hall.

ALFRID
Out of my way! Abandon the cripples!

STOP

AZOG
They cannot hold the city! The Dwarves are almost spent.

DAIN
Yer buggers!

DAIN
Thorin! Where's Thorin? We need him. Where is he?

AZOG
Let these lands run with blood! Slaughter them all.

STOP

BARD
Fall back!

DWALIN
Since when do we forsake our own people? Thorin, they are dying out there.

THORIN
There are holes beneath holes within this Mountain, places we can fortify.
Shore up, make safe? Yes. Yes, that is it. We must move the gold further underground to safety.

DWALIN
Did you not hear me? Dain is surrounded. They're being slaughtered, Thorin.

THORIN
Many die in war, life is cheap. But a treasure such as this cannot be counted in lives lost.
It is worth all the blood we can spend.

DWALIN
You sit here in these vast halls with a crown upon your head,
and yet you are lesser now than you have ever been.

THORIN
Do not speak to me as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord.
As is if I were still Thorin Oakenshield. I am your King!

DWALIN
You were always my King. You used to know that once. You were always my King.
You used to know that once. You cannot see what you have become.

THORIN
Go. Get out, before I kill you.

STOP

DAIN
Fall back! Fall back! Back to the Mountain! Fall back!

AZOG
Now comes their end. Prepare for the final assault.

KILI
I will not hide behind a wall of stone,
while others fight our battles for us! It is not in my blood, Thorin.

THORIN
No, it is not. We are sons of Durin, and Durin's folk do not flee from a fight.

THORIN
I have no right to ask this of any of you, but will you follow me, one last time?

STOP

AZOG
Not yet! Wait, wait. Attack - now!

BILBO BAGGINS
Thorin.

DAIN
To the King! To the King!

BILBO BAGGINS
The Dwarves, they're rallying.

GANDALF
They're rallying to their King.

STOP

BARD
Any man who wants to give their last, follow me!

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN #1
I say we stand with our men in life and in death.

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN #2
I'm with ya.

BAIN
Arm yourselves!

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN #3
Come with us, love.

ALFRID
No, no, no. You leave an old woman be.

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN #3
Don't be afraid.

ALFRID
I said get off!

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN #1
Alfrid Lickspittle, you are a coward.

ALFRID
A Coward? Not every man is brave enough to wear a corset.

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN #1
You're not a man, you're a weasel.

STOP

THORIN
Dain!

DAIN
Thorin! Hold on! I'm coming!

DAIN
Hey, cousin, what took you so long?

DAIN
There's too many of these buggers, Thorin. I hope you've got a plan.

THORIN
Aye, we're going to take out their leader.

DAIN
Azog?

THORIN
I'm going to kill that piece of filth.

DWALIN
Lead on!

STOP

GANDALF
We may yet survive this.

BILBO BAGGINS
Gandalf!

BILBO BAGGINS
It's Thorin.

GANDALF
And Fili and Kili and Dwalin. He's taking his best warriors.

BILBO BAGGINS
To do what?

GANDALF
To cut the head of the snake.

STOP

LEGOLAS
Gandalf! There is a second army. Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs. They are almost upon us.

GANDALF
Gundabad? Ahh. This was their plan all along. Azog engages our forces, then Bolg sweeps in from the north.

BILBO BAGGINS
What? The north? Where is the north exactly?

GANDALF
Ravenhill.

BILBO BAGGINS
Ravenhill? Thorin is up there. And Fili and Kili! They're all up there!

STOP

FILI
Where is he? It looks empty. I think Azog has fled.

THORIN
I don't think so.

THORIN
Fili, take your brother. Scout out the towers. Keep low and out of sight. If you see something, report back, do not engage. Do you understand?

DWALIN
We have company. Goblin mercenaries. No more than a hundred.

THORIN
We'll take care of them.

THORIN
Go! Go!

THRANDUIL
Recall your company.

GANDALF
My Lord, disperse this force to Ravenhill, the Dwarves are about to be overrun. Thorin must be warned.

THRANDUIL
By all means, warn him. I've spent enough Elvish blood in defense of this accursed land. No more!

GANDALF
Thranduil?

BILBO BAGGINS
I'll go.

GANDALF
Don't be ridiculous, you'll never make it.

BILBO BAGGINS
Why not?

GANDALF
Because they will see you coming, and kill you!

BILBO BAGGINS
No, they won't. They won't see me.

GANDALF
It's out of the question. I won't allow it.

BILBO BAGGINS
I'm not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.

STOP

TAURIEL
You will go no further.

TAURIEL
You will not turn away. Not this time.

THRANDUIL
Get out of my way.

TAURIEL
The Dwarves will be slaughtered.

THRANDUIL
Yes, they will die. Today, tomorrow, one year hence,
a hundred years from now. What does it matter? They are mortal.

TAURIEL
You think your life is worth more than theirs,
while there is no love in it? There is no love in you.

THRANDUIL
What do you know of love? Nothing. What you feel for that Dwarf is not real.
You think it is love? Are you ready to die for it?

LEGOLAS
If you harm her you will have to kill me.

LEGOLAS
I will go with you.

STOP

BARD
Get up.

ALFRID
Get away from me. I don't take orders from you. People trusted you, they listened to you.
The Master's mantle was there for the taking and you threw it all away. For what?

BARD
Alfrid, your slip is showing.

STOP

FILI
Stay here, search the lower levels. I've got this.

DWALIN
Where is that Orc filth?

BILBO BAGGINS
Thorin!

THORIN
Bilbo.

BILBO BAGGINS
You have to leave here. Now! Azog has another army, attacking from the north.
This watchtower will be completely surrounded, there'll be no way out.

DWALIN
We are so close. That Orc scum is in there. I say we push on.

THORIN
No! That's what he wants. He wants to draw us in. This is a trap.

THORIN
Find Fili and Kili, call them back.

DWALIN
Thorin, are you sure about this?

THORIN
Do it. We live to fight another day.

BILBO BAGGINS
Oh no.

AZOG
This one dies first. Then the brother. Then you, Oakenshield. You will die last.

FILI
Go. Run!

AZOG
Here ends your filthy bloodline!

THORIN
Kili!

DWALIN
Thorin! Thorin, no.

BOLG
Slay them all!

STOP

TAURIEL
No. Kili!

AZOG
Go in for the kill! Finish him!

TAURIEL
No, No! No.

STOP

BILBO BAGGINS
The eagles are coming.

THORIN
Bilbo.

BILBO BAGGINS
No, don't look. Don't move. Lie still.

THORIN
I'm glad you're here.

BILBO BAGGINS
Shh, shh, shh, shh-

THORIN
I wish to part from you in friendship.

BILBO BAGGINS
No, you are not going anywhere, Thorin, you're going to live.

THORIN
I would take back my words and my deeds at the gate.
You did what only a true friend would do. Forgive me.
I was too blind to see. I am so sorry that I have led you into such peril.

BILBO BAGGINS
No, I'm glad to have shared in your perils, Thorin.
Each and every one of them. It is far more than any Baggins deserves.

THORIN
Farewell, Master Burglar. Go back to your books and your armchair. Plant your trees, watch them grow.
If more people valued home above gold, this world would be a merrier place.

BILBO BAGGINS
No! No, no, no, no! No! Thorin! Thorin, don't you dare-
Thorin? Look, Thorin. Thorin, hold on. You hold on.
You see, the Eagles- the Eagles, the Eagles are here. Thorin, the Eag-

STOP

LEGOLAS
I cannot go back.

THRANDUIL
Where will you go?

LEGOLAS
I do not know.

THRANDUIL
Go north. Find the Dunedain. There is a young ranger amongst them, you should meet him.
His father Arathorn was a good man. His son might grow to be a great one.

LEGOLAS
What is his name?

THRANDUIL
He is known in the wild as Strider. His true name you must discover for yourself.

THRANDUIL
Legolas, your mother loved you, more than anyone, more than life.

STOP

TAURIEL
I want to bury him.

THRANDUIL
Yes.

TAURIEL
If this is love, I do not want it. Take it from me, please! Why does it hurt so much?

THRANDUIL
Because it was real.

STOP

BALIN
There is to be a great feast tonight. Songs will be sung,
tales will be told, and Thorin Oakenshield will pass into legend.

BILBO BAGGINS
I know that's how you must honor him, but to me, he was never that. He was to me- he was-

BILBO BAGGINS
Well, I think I'll slip quietly away, will you tell the others I said goodbye?

BALIN
You can tell them yourself.

BILBO BAGGINS
If any of you are ever passing Bag-End, tea is at four.
There's plenty of it, you are welcome any time. Don't bother knocking.

STOP

GANDALF
Ah, the borders of the Shire. It is here I must leave you.

BILBO BAGGINS
That's a shame. I quite liked having a wizard around. It seems they bring good luck.

GANDALF
You don't really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck.
Magic rings should not be used lightly, Bilbo. Don't take me for a fool, I know you found one-

BILBO BAGGINS
No.

GANDALF
In the Goblin tunnels, and I've kept my eye on you ever since.

BILBO BAGGINS
Well, thank goodness. Farewell, Gandalf.

GANDALF
Farewell.

BILBO BAGGINS
You, uh, you needn't worry about that ring, it fell out of my pocket during the battle. I lost it.

GANDALF
You're a very fine person, Mr Baggins, and I'm very fond of you.
But you're only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all.

STOP

BILBO BAGGINS
Wait a minute, that my mother's glory box. And that's my dining chair.

BILBO BAGGINS
Put that poof down! What is going on?

MASTER WORRYWORT
Hello, mister Bilbo. You're not supposed to be here.

BILBO BAGGINS
What do you mean?

MASTER WORRYWORT
On account of you being presumed dead and all.

BILBO BAGGINS
I am not dead, presumed or otherwise.

MASTER WORRYWORT
I'm not sure that's permitted! Mister Bilbo!

TOSSER GRUB
-anyone. Any advance on twenty-one? Any advance on twenty-one? Sold to Mrs. Bolder! Somewhere for Fatty to put his feet on.

TOSSER GRUB
So do I have any bids for this. This is Shire-made. None of your Dwarvish reproductions here, honestly.

BILBO BAGGINS
Stop! Stop! There's been a mistake!

LOBELIA SACKVILLE BAGGINS
Who are you?

BILBO BAGGINS
What do you mean "who am I?" You know perfectly well who I am, Lobelia Sackville Baggins.
This is my home. And those are my spoons, thank you very much.

TOSSER GRUB
This is most irregular. It's been more than thirteen months since the disappearance,
if you are in fact Bilbo Baggins and un-deceased. Can you prove it?

BILBO BAGGINS
What?

TOSSER GRUB
Well, uh, something official with your name on it would suffice.

BILBO BAGGINS
Alright. Right!

BILBO BAGGINS
A contract of employment as a bur-. Never mind as to what.

BILBO BAGGINS
There, my signature.

TOSSER GRUB
Yes, well. Oh, it certainly seems to be in order. Yes, it seems there can be no doubt.

TOSSER GRUB
Who is this person you pledged your service to? Thorin Oakenshield?

BILBO BAGGINS
He was my friend.
