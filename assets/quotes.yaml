      - "**{0}:** I need 28 lightbulbs for 28 ducks. \n**{1}:** Ducks can't eat lightbulbs? \n**{2}:** I think that's the point. \n**{0}:** Exactly. I want my ducks to glow so I can find them."
      - "{ast}{0} dies in a game with ships{ast} \n**{1}:** This ship is no longer a ship of love, it's a ship of vengeance, a gavel of justice against all that is wrong in the world, showing no mercy, as no mercy was shown to us. \n**{1}:** The spark of love will now fuel the fires of destructive glory as I wage my war across the world with righteous fury. \n**{2}:** Legend has it that {0} still haunts the ship, stealing my fucking drinks. \n**{0}:** Of course I do."

      - "**{0}:** Have you done this before? \n**{1}:** Well, {0}, it's like if you read the script you come better prepared. \n**{2}:** That's not what we do in the US, we don't read things. \n**{0}:** I don't read, {1}."
