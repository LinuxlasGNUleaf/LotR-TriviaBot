            **How the config works:**
            You can set preferences for a server or a channel (DMs excluded),
            which means you set the feature to on / off.
            If set, the channel preference for a feature will __always__ be preferred.
            If the channel preference for this feature is not set, the server-preference will be used.
            If the server-preference is not set either, the the feature is allowed by default.

            **How to use the config command:**
            `{0} config <feature> on` to turn <feature> **ON** for this channel
            `{0} config <feature> off` to turn <feature> **OFF** for this channel
            `{0} config <feature> unset` to **UNSET** <feature> setting for this channel
            (the server preferences are used, or if these are not set either, the defaults.)

            `{0} config <feature> server-on` to set the server default for <feature> to **ON**
            (all channels where the bot has send_messages permission)
            `{0} config <feature> server-off` to set the server default for <feature> to **OFF**
            `{0} config <feature> server-unset` to **UNSET** the server default for <feature>
            (the channel preferences are used, or if these are not set, directly the defaults.)
