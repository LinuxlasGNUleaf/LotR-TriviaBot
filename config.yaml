            **How the settings work:**
            You can use the settings command in cases where you want to enable / disable specific categories.
            *Please note: If you want to completely turn off the bot in some parts of your server, use Channel Settings
            to disallow the bot to prevent the bot from sending messages there.*
            
            You can set preferences for a server or a channel (DMs excluded), which means you set the category to on / off.
            If set, the *channel preference* for a category will __always__ be preferred.
            If the *channel preference* for this category is not set, the server-preference will be used.
            If the *server preference* is not set either, the hardcoded fallback values are used.
            Refer to the attached image for further clarification. 


            **How to use the config command:**
            Syntax: `{0}setting [channel/server] [category] [on/off/reset]`
            - *First argument*: Edit channel-wide or server-wide settings?

            - *Second argument*: Which category do you want to edit?
            These are the categories that are available:
            {1}

            - *Third argument*: What mode do you want the setting to have?
            These are the modes that are available:
            `on`,`off`,`reset`
            Note: `reset` deletes the server/channel-preference, which makes the bot fall back to the next layer (see attached image) 

        # list of config categories (for internal use only, don't edit)
