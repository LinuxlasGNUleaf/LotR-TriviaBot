DEAGOL
Smeagol, I've got one!
I've got a fish, Smeagol!

SMEAGOL
Go on, pull it in.

SMEAGOL
Deagol!

STOP

SMEAGOL
Give us that, Deagol, my love!

DEAGOL turns to look at him, a smirk on his face.

DEAGOL
Why?

SMEAGOL
Because its my birthday, and I wants it.

SMEAGOL
My precious!

STOP

SMEAGOL
They cursed us. Murderer. Murderer they
called us. They cursed us and drove us
away.

SMEAGOL
And we wept, Precious, we wept to be so
alone. And we forgot the taste of bread,
the sound of trees, the softness of the
wind. We even forgot our own name.
Gollum! Gollum!

GOLLUM
It's mine! My own. It came to me.

SMEAGOL
My Precious.

STOP

GOLLUM
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We
must go, yes, we must go at once!

SAM
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo?

SAM
I've gone and had too much!

SAM
It must be getting late.

FRODO
No, no it isn't. It isn't midday yet.
The days are growing darker.

GOLLUM
Come on, must go, no time!

SAM
Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.

GOLLUM
- no time to lose, silly!

SAM
Here.

FRODO
What about you?

SAM
I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas
bread.

FRODO
Sam.

SAM
Alright. We don't have that much left.
We have to be careful or we're going to run
out. You go ahead and eat that, Mr Frodo.
I've rationed it. There should be enough.

FRODO
For what?

SAM
The journey home.

STOP

GOLLUM
Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close
to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry!
Shhh.

STOP

PIPPIN
I feel like I'm back at the Green Dragon,
after a hard days work.

MERRY
Only, you've never done a hard days work.

STOP

MERRY
Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard.

GIMLI
You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led
us on, and now we find you feasting and
smoking.

PIPPIN
We are sitting on a field of victory,
enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
The salted pork is particularly good.

GIMLI
Salted pork?

GANDALF
Hobbits!

MERRY
We're under orders from Treebeard, who's
taken over management of Isengard.

STOP

TREEBEARD
Huraroom. Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad
you've come. Wood and water, stock and ,
stone I can master, but there's a wizard to
be managed here. Locked in his tower.

GANDALF
And there Saruman must remain, under your
guard, Treebeard.

GIMLI
Let's just have his head and be done with
it!

GANDALF
No. He has no power any more.

TREEBEARD
The filth of Saruman is washing away.
Trees will come back to live here, young
trees, wild trees.

STOP

TREEBEARD
Well bless my bark!

GANDALF
Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!
Quickly, now!

STOP

THEODEN
Tonight we remember those who gave their
blood to defend this country. Hail the
victorious dead!

EOWYN
Westu Aragorn hal.

STOP

THEODEN
I am happy for you.
He is an honourable man.

EOWYN
You are both honourable men.

THEODEN
It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our
people to victory.

THEODEN
Don't listen to me - you are young, and
tonight is for you.

MERRY & PIPPIN
Oh, you can search - up and down
As many lands as can be found
But you'll never find a beer so brown
As the one we drink in our home town
You can keep your fancy ales
You can drink them by the flagon
But the only brew, for the brave and true,
Comes from the Green Dragon!

ARAGORN
No news of Frodo?

GANDALF
No word, nothing.

ARAGORN
We still have time.

ARAGORN
Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

GANDALF
Do we know that?

ARAGORN
What does your heart tell you?

GANDALF
That Frodo is alive.

GANDALF
Yes. Yes, he is alive.

STOP

SMEAGOL
Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They
stole it from us. Kill them- kill them-
kill them both!

SMEAGOL
No!

GOLLUM
Shhh! Quiet!

SMEAGOL'S features suddenly transform into the MALEVOLENT
face of GOLLUM!

GOLLUM
Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

SMEAGOL casts a quick glance over his SHOULDER to the
SLEEPING figures of FRODO and SAM as he clambers off his ROCK
... silently sidling towards the EDGE of a STAGNANT POOL.

SMEAGOL
They knows, they knows, they suspects us.
SMEAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER.

The SURFACE RIPPLES as the face of GOLLUM appears as SMEAGOL'S
REFLECTION.

GOLLUM
What is it saying, my precious, my love?
Is Smeagol losing his nerve?

SMEAGOL :
No! Not! Never!! Smeagol hates nasty
Hobbitses! Smeagol wants to see: them -
dead!

GOLLUM
And we will. Smeagol did it once -
He can do it again.

SMEAGOL
We must get the Precious. We must get it
back.

GOLLUM
Patience, patience, my love. First we must
lead them to her.

SMEAGOL
We lead them to the windy stairs.

GOLLUM
Yes, the stairs. And then?

SMEAGOL
Up, up, up, up the stairs we go, until
we come to - the Tunnel!

GOLLUM
And when they go in, there's no coming out.
She's always hungry, she always needs to
feed. She must eat, all she gets is filthy
Orcses.

SMEAGOL
And they doesn't taste very nice, does
they, Precious?

GOLLUM
No, not very nice at all, my love. She
hungers for sweeter meats.

GOLLUM
"Hobbit meat." And when She throws away the
bones and the empty clothes, then we will
find it.

SMEAGOL
And take it for Me!

GOLLUM
For us...

SMEAGOL
Yes, we, we meant for us...
Gollum! Gollum!

GOLLUM
The Precious will be ours once the
Hobbitses are dead!

SAM
You treacherous little toad!

GOLLUM
No! Not! Help! Master!

FRODO
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

SAM
I heard it from his own mouth he means
to murder us!

SMEAGOL
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly!
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol
and who makes up nasty lies!

SAM makes for SMEAGOL again... with a look of MURDEROUS
RAGE.

SAM
You miserable little maggot! I'll stove
your head in!

FRODO grabs SAM'S ARM.

FRODO
Sam!

SAM
Call me a liar! You're a liar!

FRODO
Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost.

SAM pulls away from FRODO...

SAM
I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I
won' t wait around for him to kill us!

FRODO
I'm not sending him away.

SAM stares at FRODO... at a loss.

SAM
You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!

FRODO
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not
without a guide. I need you on my side.

SAM
I'm on your side, Mr Frodo.

FRODO
I know, Sam, I know.
You must trust me.

FRODO beckons to GOLLUM.

FRODO
Come, Smeagol.

GOLLUM turns slowly, staring at SAM through hooded, HATE-FILLED
EYES... and SMILES.

LEGOLAS
The stars are veiled, something stirs in
the east... A sleepless malice.

LEGOLAS looks at ARAGORN... realisation in his face.

LEGOLAS
The eye of the enemy is moving.

FIDGETY...

Suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the SLEEPING FORM
of GANDALF.

MERRY
What you doing?

PIPPIN gasps with FRIGHT! MERRY is sitting up, wiping sleep
from his eyes. He moves on...

PIPPIN is undeterred...

MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face.

MERRY
Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?

With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTIR from
GANDALF'S grasp...

MERRY
Pippin, are you mad?

PIPPIN
I just want to look at it. Just one more
time.

MERRY
Put it back! Put - it - back!

PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTIR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED,
he gazes INTENTLY into it.

MERRY
Pippin!

As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light
slowly spreads from the GLASS BALL onto PIPPIN'S FACE... his
EYES WIDEN.

MERRY
Pippin!

LEGOLAS
He is here!

PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE... He STAGGERS
BACKWARDS, PALANTIR held rigidly before him...

THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE... PIPPIN
is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT.

PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM
... He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY GLOBE.

MERRY
Help! Someone help him!

GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and
wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS... PIPPIN FALLS to
the FLOOR!... ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the
PALANTIR falling from his HANDS...

The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the
room to COWER BACK. ;
on his face! He rounds on PIPPIN. ,

GANDALF
Fool of a Took!

GANDALF lifts the HOBBIT'S SLUMPED HEAD.

MERRY
Pippin!

PIPPIN is trembling... GANDALF calms him...

PIPPIN
Gandalf! Forgive me.

GANDALF
Look at me! What did you see?

PIPPIN
A tree. There was a white tree in a
courtyard of stone. It was dead!

PIPPIN
The city was burning.

GANDALF
Minas Tirith?
Is that what you saw?

PIPPIN
I saw- I saw him. I could hear his voice in my head.

GANDALF
And what did you tell him? Speak!

PIPPIN
He asked me my name, I didn't answer. He hurt me-

GANDALF
What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?

STOP

GANDALF
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool,
but an honest fool he remains. He told
Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

GANDALF
We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
enemy's plan.

GANDALF
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
our enemy one thing.

GANDALF
The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
not as weak as he supposed. There is
courage still - strength enough left to
challenge him.

THEODEN listens intently, saying nothing.

GANDALF
Sauron fears this. He will not risk the
peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one
banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the
ground before he sees the return of the King.

GANDALF
If the beacons of Condor are lit, Rohan
must be ready for war!

THEODEN
Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of
those who did not come to ours?

THEODEN
What do we owe Gondor?

ARAGORN
I will go.

GANDALF
No!

ARAGORN
They must be warned.

GANDALF
They will be.

GANDALF
You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.
Follow the river, look to the black ships.

GANDALF
Understand this... things are now in
motion that cannot be undone.

GANDALF
I ride for Minas Tirith! And I won't be
going alone!

STOP

GANDALF
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin,
Took, you are the worst. Hurry, hurry!

PIPPIN catches up to MERRY.

PIPPIN
Where are we going?

MERRY
Why did you look - why do you always have
to look?

PIPPIN
I don't know... I can't help it.

MERRY turns away...

MERRY
You never can.

PIPPIN
I'm sorry, alright? I won't do it again.

MERRY
Don't you understand... the Enemy thinks
you have the Ring... he's going to be
looking for you, Pip. They have to get you
out of here!

PIPPIN
And you. You're coming with me...
Merry?

MERRY
Come on!

PUSH IN: PIPPIN'S face as MERRY strides away.

SHADOWFAX as GANDALF hurriedly prepares to leave...

PIPPIN

How far is Minas Tirith?

GANDALF
Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and
you'd better hope we don't have one of
those on our tail.

MERRY thrusts a SMALL PACKAGE into PIPPIN'S HAND...

MERRY
Here - something for the road.

PIPPIN stares down at the leather-bound bundle of PIPE-WEED.

PIPPIN
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

MERRY
I know you've run out... you smoke too
much, Pip.

PIPPIN
But we'11 see each other soon?

A WORRIED MERRY exchanges glances with GANDALF.

PIPPIN
Won't we?

MERRY
I don't know... I don't know what's going
to happen.

GANDALF mounts SHADOWFAX.

PIPPIN

Merry?

GANDALF spurs the GREAT HORSE forward.

GANDALF
Run Shadowfax, show us the meaning of
haste.

PIPPIN

Merry!

SHADOWFAX thunders out of the STABLES!

GATE and down the WINDING ROAD towards the PLAINS QF ROHAN.

DISAPPEAR into the DISTANCE...

WIDE: ARWEN - escorted by a SMALL ENTOURAGE of ELVES - rides
through the gathering darkness of a PINE FOREST...

ELROND
Take her by the safest road. A ship lies
anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to
carry her across the Sea... The last
journey of Arwen Undomiel.

SLOW MOTION: As ARWEN rides through the FOREST the FIGURE of
a SMALL BOY of about 5 SUDDENLY runs across the path in front
of her.

ARWEN reigns in ASFALOTH... something about the BOY
intrigues her.- but she does not know why...

As ARWEN watches the BOY moves away, the TREES begin to thin
... the BOY continues running. One by one the TREES TRANSFORM
into TALL WHITE PILLARS...

ARWEN'S POV: The BOY now stands within a VISION of the
majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of MINAS
TIRITH.

A SILHOUETTED FIGURE appears in the distance and moves
towards the CHILD... the BOY runs to the FIGURE.

ARWEN watches as the FIGURE holds out its arms - swinging the
LAUGHING CHILD into the AIR...

The figure turns to reveal... ARAGORN, a little older,
dressed in the casual finery of a GONDORIAN NOBLE.

ARWEN... it is a QUIET LOOK filled with INFINITE SADNESS.

ARWEN'S eyes drop to the CHILD'S CHEST... around the CHILD'S
neck hangs the EVENSTAR...

that can never be, the CHILD she and ARAGORN will never have.

ELROND
Arwen, there is nothing for you here...
only death.

ARWEN shuts her eyes... when she opens them again the VISION
is gone... she is staring at DARK TREES once more.

ELF ESCORT
Lady Arwen?

ARWEN turns towards her COMPANION who stares at her,
concerned.

ELF ESCORT
We cannot delay.

SUDD ENLY: ARWEN wheels ASFAL OTH ar ound... riding away.

ELF ESCORT

My Lady!

WIDE SHOT: ARWEN'S HORSE gallops over the BRIDGE and through
the GATES into RIVENDELL.

towards him...

ARWEN
What did you see?

ELROND
Arwen?

fierce light in her eyes...

ARWEN
You have the gift of foresight - tell me
what you have seen.

.

ELROND
I looked into your future and I saw death.

ARWEN
There is also life. ,

Her father turns away...

ARWEN
You saw there was a child...
you saw my son.

ELROND stares into space, the fight seems to go out of him.
He won't look at her...

ELROND

That future is almost gone.

ARWEN
But it is not lost...

ELROND
Nothing is certain.

and turns him toward her...

ARWEN
Some things are certain. If I leave him now
I will regret It forever.

Ada, it is time.

towards a GALLERY... The FIGURE stops before a STATUE that
holds the BROKEN SHARDS of an ancient sword in its arms.

ARWEN
From the ashes of fire shall be woken,
a light from the shadow shall spring,
renewed shall be blade that was broken.

ARWEN
The crownless again shall be King.

ARWEN
Reforge the sword.

ARWEN
Ada...

ELROND
Your hands are cold.

The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

ELROND
It has begun.

ARWEN
This was my choice. Ada... Whether by your
will or not, there is no ship now that can
bear me hence.

GANDALF
We have just passed into the realm of
Condor!

its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out-
thrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH.

With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it
seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth.

GANDALF
Minas Tirith... City of the Kings.

Suddenly the SUN climbs over the eastern hills, and sends
forth a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT that GLEAMS against th e face of the
CITY. The TOWER OF ECTHELION stands high within the topmost
walls. WHITE BANNERS break and FLUTTER from the BATTLEMENTS
in the morning breeze.

GANDALF steering SHADOWFAX up the STEEP STREETS of MINAS
TIRITH.

PIPPIN gallop through the WINDING STREETS...

AERIAL SHOT: SHADOWFAX, carrying GANDALF and PIPPIN up
towards the 7th LEVEL.

MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS - each behind a CIRCULAR
DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises - the city reaches a height
of nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL.

A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK - shaped like a sharp
ship's prow - bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP.

SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the
CITY - 1000 FEET above the PELENNOR FIELDS.

GANDALF and PIPPIN dismount, leaving the GUARDS of the
CITADEL to tend to SHADOWFAX. GANDALF hurries off...

caught by a DEAD TREE that stands in the middle of the COURT,
FOUR SOLEMN CITADEL GUARDS standing sentry around it.

PIPPIN ;
.

It's the tree. ,

Gandalf! Gandalf!

GANDALF
Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of
the King.

GANDALF leads PIPPIN across a FLAT COURT of WHITE STONES,
surrounded by GREEN LAWNS... towards a GREAT HALL benejath
the GLEAMING TOWER. '
\

GANDALF
Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He
is a steward only. A caretaker of the
throne.

GANDALF lowers his voice, as they approach the TOWER HALL.

·,

GA ND ALF 

Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
Boromir's father. To give him news of his
beloved son's death would be most unwise
... And do not mention Frodo... Or the
Ring... And say nothing of Aragorn either.

In fact, it's better if you don't speak at
all, Pippin Took.

PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a silent company of TALL
KINGS carved in cold STONE.

GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following
obediently behind.

At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE,
EMPTY THRONE... and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a
FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS.

At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD
MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR - the Lord Steward of
CONDOR.

GANDALF
Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
Steward of Gondor.

DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.

GANDALF
I come with tidings in this dark hour - and
with counsel.

DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES...

DENETHOR

Perhaps you come to explain this?

DENETHOR holds up BOROMIR'S BROKEN HORN...

DEN ETH OR 
Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is
dead?

he falls to his KNEES...

PIPPIN starts forward unable to say nothing...

.. PIPPIN
Boromir died to save us... my kinsman and
me... he fell, defending us from many
foes.

GANDALF

Pippin!

PIPPIN drops to his knee offering DENETHOR his SWORD...

PIPPIN
I offer you my service, such as it is, in
payment of this debt.

DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.:

GANDALF

Get up!

My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming
... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As
Steward, you are charged with the defence
of this city. Where are Condor's armies?

DENETHOR gaze turns slowly on GANDALF...

GANDALF
You still have friends - you are not alone
in this fight. Send word to Theoden of
Rohan. Light the beacons.

DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something.

DENETHOR

You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for
all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do
you think the eyes of the White Tower are
blind? I have seen more than you know. With
your left hand you would use me as a shield
against Mordor and with your right you
would seek to supplant me.

DENETHOR

I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,
yes. Word has reached my ears of this
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
North - last of a ragged house, long bereft
of Lordship.

GANDALF

Authority is not given to you to deny the
return of the King - Steward!

DENETHOR

The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!

closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, PIPPIN
follows.

GANDALF
Come.

GANDALF and PIPPIN stride from the TOWER HALL... DENETHOR
slumps back into his SEAT.

the ROYAL GUARD on a bed.

PIPPIN
So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial
position... I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting... do they?

WIDE: GANDALF STANDING QUIETLY on a BALCONY that overlooks
the GREAT CITY.

GANDALF
You're in the service of the Steward now -
you're going to have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took...

Guard of the Citadel!

PIPPIN
It's so quiet.

GANDALF watches the young HOBBIT.
GANDALF
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

PIPPIN
I don't want to be in a battle... but
waiting on the edge of one I can't escape
is even worse. L
 :
Is there any hope, Gandalf - for Frodo and
Sam?

GANDALF joins PIPPIN as they look towards the distant, jagged
MOUNTAINS of MORDOR...

GANDALF
There never was much hope.

PIPPIN looks up at him, unnerved. GANDALF gives him a small
self-deprecating smile...

GANDALF
Just a fool's hope.

GANDALF and PIPPIN share a quiet moment as they stare out
towards the FIERY SKY over MORDOR...

GANDALF
Our enemy is almost ready, his full
strength gathered. Not only Orcs, but men
as well.

GANDALF
Legions of Haradrim from the South.

GANDALF
Mercenaries from the coast... All will
answer Mordor' s call.

GANDALF
This will be the end of Gondor as we know
it. Here the hammerstroke will fall
hardest.

bastion between MINAS TIRITH and MORDOR...

GANDALF
If the river is taken, if the garrison at
Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this
city will be gone.

PIPPIN
But we have the White Wizard. That's got to
count for something.

GANDALF looks down at PIPPIN, he says nothing...

PIPPIN

Gandalf?

GANDALF stares into the distance as if seeing something in
his mind's eye.

being dressed in ARMOUR by attendant ORCS...

GANDALF
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest
servant... The one who will lead Mordor's
armies in war, the one they say no living
man can kill.

GANDALF
The Witchking of Angmar.
You've met him before.

GANDALF
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

G AN DA LF 
He is the Lord of the Nazgul - the greatest
of the nine...

GANDALF
And Minas Morgul is his lair.

ROUGH-HEWN ROAD... GOLLUM CAREFULLY.peers OVER the lip of
the GULLY ___

KNEE at the HEAD OF THE morgul valley. CORRUPT and LOATHSOME,
it glows with a SICKLY LUMINOUS LIGHT - like a CORPSE CANDLE.

TWO HUGE, BESTIAL STONE STATUES guard the BRIDGE that leads
to the CITY...

GOLLUM

The Dead City, very nasty place, full of
... enemies.

GOLLUM, FRODO and SAM hurry from their COVER scampering in
the SHADOWS towards MINAS MORGUL...

GOLLUM

Quick! Quick! They will see, they will see.

SENSES START REELING.

GOLLUM
Come away, come away. Look! We have found
it.

FRODO and SAM look AGHAST at the sight of a NARROW, NEAR-
VERTICAL STAIRCASE, cut into the ROCK-FACE... Directly in
FRONT of the MINAS MORGUL GATES.

GOLLUM
The way into Mordor!

sheer western side of the MORGUL VALLEY - to the HIGH PEAKS
of the razor-like MOUNTAINS OF MORDOR.

GOLLUM
The secret stairs... climb!

SUDDENLY! FRODO staggers across the ROAD... as if some
FORCE, other than his own will, is at work! He lurches
towards the BRIDGE... towards MINAS MORGUL!

SAM
No, Mr Frodo!

GOLLUM

Not that way!

SAM runs after FRODO, catching him in his arms as he STUMBLES,

GOLLUM
What's it doing?

SAM
No!

SAM and GOLLUM pull FRODO from the BRIDGE.

FRODO

They're calling me!

FRODO falls to the GROUND.

AT THAT MOMENT: the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING
NOISE rolls across the ground and ECHOES in the mountains.

The cold, dull MORGUL VALLEY is suddenly VIOLENT and FIERCE,
as UPRUSHING FLAME springs from MOUNT DOOM.

MINAS MORGUL ANSWERS: A FLARE of LIVID LIGHTNING, FORKS of
BLUE FLAME, SPRING UP from the TOWER into the SULLEN CLOUD.

... SHARP THUNDER rolls across 40 MILES to MINAS TIRITH.

comforting HAND rests on his shoulder.

SAM and GOLLUM lead FRODO to the STAIRS...

ABOVE MINAS MORGUL the SKY is BRIGHT with LIGHT as the CITY,
erupts...

GOLLUM
Hide! Hide!

they watch from the PARAPETS of the CITY.

STOP

FRODO
I can feel his blade!

THE CAVERNOUS GATE of MINAS MORGUL swings OPEN...

... and. a HUGE ARMY MARCHES OUT!

RANK upon RANK of ARMOUR CLAD ORCS, moving SWIFTLY and
SILENTLY, pass close to FRODO and SAM in an ENDLESS STREAM of
RAGGED COLUMNS!

GANDALF
We come to it at last... the great battle of our time.

GANDALF
This war is long planned. Sauron has hated
the west through many ages... It is a
hatred that flows from the depths of time,
across the deeps of the Sea.

The WITCH KING SWOOPS down the VALLEY to join the HEAD of his
ARMY. He vanishes into the GLOOM - a shadow into shadow.

GOLLUM

Come, hobbits. We climb - we must climb!

above the MARCHING ARMY.

GANDALF

The board is set, the pieces are moving.

DETERMINED and PURPOSEFUL is he, that PIPPIN has to RUN to
keep up. GANDALF suddenly stops and looks down at PIPPIN...

GANDALF
Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to
be done. Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth!

GANDALF kneels down and looks at PIPPIN earnestly, his hand
on PIPPIN'S shoulder.

GANDALF
You must not fail me.

GANDALF watches as PIPPIN hurries away.

WIDE ON: An ANCIENT STONE BRIDGE which spans the RUINS of
EAST and WEST OSGILIATH - a once MIGHTY GONDORIAN CITY.

WIDE ON: ITHILIEN RANGERS patrolling the BRIDGE and the
RIVERBANK.

WEST OSGILIATH has fallen into disrepair, but the DESOLATION
of EAST OSGILIATH is more pronounced - it is held by the
FORCES of MORDOR.

Faster!

ON THE RIVER the BOATS quietly advance.

Draw swords!

SWORD drawn. A FIERCE BATTLE ensues, but FARAMIR is unable to
stop the advance as HUNDREDS OF ORCS cross the WIDE BRIDGE
into WEST OSGILIATH.

TIRITH, 1000 FEET BELOW, as PIPPIN desperately scrambles up
the ROCKY MOUNTAINSIDE.

PIPPIN clambers over a ROCKY LEDGE and ducks behind a STONE

STEEDS amid great activity.

EOMER and his SOLDIERS...

THEODEN
Assemble the army at Dunharrow - as many
men as can be found. You have two days...
On the third, we ride for Condor... and

THEODEN
Gamling, make haste across the Riddermark

ARAGORN
You ride with us?

EOWYN turns and runs SMACK into ARAGORN...

EOWYN
Just to the encampment. It's tradition for
the women of the Court to farewell the men.

ARAGORN smiles... reaching past her, he lifts a cover to reveal
a SWORD, strapped to the side of the saddle of her HORSE.

EOWYN deftly pulls the cover back down. She looks at ARAGORN.

EOWYN

The Men have found their Captain - they
will follow you into battle, even to death.

You have given us hope.

PULL BACK: to reveal THEODEN stares around at the STREETS and
PEOPLE of EDORAS... it is as if he knows he will not see
this place again.

THEODEN
So... It is before the walls of Minas
Tirith that the doom of our time will be
decided.

Now is the hour! Riders of Rohan - oaths

MADRIL
We can't hold them. The city is lost!

FARAMIR
Tell the men to break up. We ride for Minas

ON THE SOUNDTRACK: OMINOUS SOUNDS of WIND RISING... HUGE
WINGS BEATING...

RANGER
Nazgul!

SPINNING ANGLE: FARAMIR looks up at the SKY... ITHILIEN
RANGERS are suddenly nervous, frightened... A HUGE SHADOW
passes overhead!

FARAMIR
Take cover!

A SUDDEN TERRIFYING SHRIEK rends the AIR!

FARAMIR
Pull back! Pull back to Minas Tirith!

footsteps approach...

over the prone figure of the INJURED RANGER.

Grabbing a spear from a nearby underling, GOTHMOG drives the
shaft into MADRIL'S chest...

GOTHMOG
The age of men is over. The time of the Ore
has come.

FARAMIR and a few survivors flee WEST OSGILIATH, desperately
riding toward MINAS TIRITH... in the SKY above DARK SHAPES
pursue them...

TILT DOWN... following the NAZGUL as it SWOOPS out of LOW-
LYING, MURKY CLOUDS tossing MEN in the AIR like LIMP RAG-DOLLS!

AT THAT MOMENT: Across the PLAIN, a FIGURE clothed in WHITE
rides towards them!

From the BATTLEMENTS of MINAS TIRITH, a call... "The White
Rider!"

WIDE ON: GANDALF as he spurs SHADOWFAX forward! PIPPIN clings
tightly to the great horses MANE.

AGAIN the FELL-BEASTS DIVE low...

GANDALF thunders into view, raising his STAFF...

A SHAFT OF WHITE LIGHT suddenly stabs upwards! The NAZGUL
SWERVES AWAY from the LIGHT, as it pierces the LOW CLOUD!

For a BRIEF MOMENT, SUNLIGHT streams through the hole onto
PELENNOR FIELDS... The NAZGUL circle away from the SUN RAYS,
swiftly spiralling higher and higher.

The NAZGUL defeated, GANDALF and the RANGERS ride towards the
safety of MINAS TIRITH.

IORLAS
Open the Gates! Pull!

The GREAT GATES OPEN, allowing GANDALF, PIPPIN, FARAMIR and
the OSGILIATH SURVIVORS to RIDE IN... Nearly 100 WOUNDED AND
SHOCKED MEN.

AS GANDALF pulls SHADOWFAX up...

FARAMIR
Mithrandir!

GANDALF...

FARAMIR
They broke through our defences. They have
taken the bridge a nd the West Bank.
Battalions of Orcs are crossing the River.

IORLAS
It is as the Lord Denethor predicted - long
has he foreseen this doom!

GANDALF
Foreseen and done nothing!

FARAMIR suddenly STARES at PIPPIN. GANDALF reads the surprise
in his eyes.

GA ND ALF 
Faramir?... This is not the first halfling
to have crossed your path...

FARAMIR shakes his head.

FARAMIR
No.

PIPPIN

You've seen Frodo and Sam?

FARAMIR NODS.

GANDALF
Where? When?

FARAMIR
In Ithilien, not two days ago. Gandalf -
they are taking the road to the Morgul
Vale.

GANDALF

... And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.

PIPPIN
What does that mean? What's wrong?

GANDALF

Faramir... Tell me everything.

Get back, you. Don't touch him!

GOLLUM'S out-stretched HAND suddenly GRASPS FRODO'S ARM
pulling him SAFELY onto the LEDGE.

GOLLUM glares down at SAM.

PIPPIN

Here do I swear fealty and service to
Gondor, in peace or war, in living or
dying, from this hour henceforth, until my
lord release me, or death take me.

DENETHOR
And I shall not forget it, nor fail to
reward that which is given...

DENETHOR

DENETHOR addresses his meal...

DENETHOR

I do not think we should so lightly abandon
the outer defences; defences that your
brother long held intact.

FARAMIR
What would you have me do?

DENETHOR
I will not yield the River and Pelennor
unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken.

FARAMIR
My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

DENETHOR
Much must be risked in war. Is there a
Captain here who still has the courage to
do his Lord's will?

FARAMIR

You wish now that our places had been
exchanged, that I had died and Boromir had
lived?

then...

DENETHOR

Yes, I wish that.

FARAMIR
Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do
what I can in his stead.

SAM watches a sleeping GOLLUM suspiciously as he desperately

SAM breathes deeply now, heavily asleep.

SAM
What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?

SMEAGOL

Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so
polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that
nobody else could find and they say
"Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh
yes, my Precious, very nice.

SAM
Alright, alright - you just startled me is
all.

What were you doing?

SMEAGOL

Sneaking!

Too exhausted to argue, SAM turns away.

SAM
Fine, have it your own way.

SAM gently shakes FRODO'S shoulder. -

SAM
Sorry to wake you, Mr Frodo. We have to be
moving on.

SAM rummages through his KNAPSACK, looking for a bite to eat.
FRODO sits up slowly.

FRODO
It's dark still.

SAM
It's always dark here -

SAM
It's gone... the Elven bread!

FRODO

What? That's all we have left!

SAM slowly turns to GOLLUM...

SAM

He took it! He must have!

GOLLUM

Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol
hates nasty Elf bread!

SAM
You're a lying wretch! What did you do with
it?

FRODO
He doesn't eat it... he can't have taken
it.

GOLLUM
What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses!

He took it! He took it! I seen him, he's

That's a filthy lie!

SAM

You stinking two-faced sneak! Call me a
thief!

FRODO
Sam! Stop it!

SAM
I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

FRODO
No, Sam!

FRODO COLLAPSES on the GROUND!

SAM
Alight, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to
go so far, I was so angry... Here, let's
rest up a bit.

SAM attempts to fuss around FRODO...

FRODO

I'm alright.

SAM
No, no, you're not alright! You're
exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this
place; it's that thing around your neck. I
could help a bit... I could carry it for a
while - share the load.

FRODO
Get away!

FRODO pushes SAM away, clutching at the RING beneath his shirt

SAM

I don't want to keep it... I just want to
help!

FRODO rises to his FEET, as if empowered with a frightening
intense ENERGY.

GOLLUM
See! See! He wants it for himself.

SAM

Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of here.

FRODO

No, Sam... it's you.

SAM stares at FRODO with DISBELIEF.
/

FRODO
I'm sorry, Sam...

SAM

But... he's a liar... he's poisoned you
against me.

FRODO
You can't help me anymore.

SAM
You don't mean that.

FRODO

Go home.

MISERY.

STREETS towards the CITY GATE... PEOPLE are rushing forward,
THROWING FLOWERS over the KNIGHTS.

GANDALF
Faramir! Your father's will has turned to
madness! Do not throw away your life so
rashly!

FARAMIR

Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

GANDALF reads the PAIN in FARAMIR'S eyes... he calls after
him, trying one more time to stop the YOUNG MAN.

GANDALF
Your father loves you, Faramir!

And will remember it before the end.

HIGH ANGLE: FARAMIR leads the 200 MOUNTED KNIGHTS through the
GATES OF MINAS TIRITH and across the PELENNOR FIELDS towards
the RUINS of OSGILIATH.

BATTLEMENTS.

HIGH WIDE: FARAMIR'S KNIGHTS FAN OUT... to form one straight
line of 200 HORSEMEN.

GOTHMOG and his MEN watch as the KNIGHTS approach.

FAST PUSH IN... to PIPPIN looking on as DENETHOR eats.

DENETHOR
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

PIPPIN

Well... yes, at least, well enough for my
own people... but we have no songs for
great halls and evil times... we seldom
sing of anything more terrible than wind or
rain.

DENETHOR
And why should your songs be unfit for my
halls, or for hours such as these. Come -
sing me a song!

PIPPIN'S simple, clear voice echoes through the VAST HALL.

PIPPIN
Home is behind, the world ahead,
And there are many paths to tread.
Through shadow to the edge of night
Until the stars are all alight.
Mist and shadow, cloud and shade:
All shall fade, all shall fade.

THEODEN
Grimbold, how many?

GRIMBOLD
I bring five hundred men from the Westfold,
my Lord.

ROHAN MARSHALL 
We have three hundred more from Fenmarch,
Theoden, King.

THEODEN smiles grimly as he rides on.

DENETHOR
Where are the riders from Snowbourne?

GAMLING
None have come, My Lord.

ARAGORN joins THEODEN on a BLUFF overlooking the ENCAMPMENT
BELOW...

CAMERA CRANES to REVEAL: THOUSANDS of MEN and HORSES! Smoke
from many small CAMP-FIRES has filled the VALLEY with a
TWILIGHT HAZE.

THEODEN

Six thousand spears... less than half of
what I had hoped for...

ARAGORN
Six thousand will not be enough to break
the lines of Mordor.

THEODEN
More will come.

ARAGORN ;
Every hour lost hastens Condor's defeat. We
have till dawn. Then we must ride.

THEODEN nods.

The HORSES whinny loudly in the distance... THEODEN looks up
at the MOUNTAIN which looms behind them...

they sit quiet and hunched... no-one speaking...

LEGOLAS looking toward EOMER who is unsaddling his HORSE...

LEGOLAS
The horses are restless. And the men are quiet.

EOMER
They grow nervous in the shadow of the
mountain...

GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that
mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading away from the ENCAMPMENT
and INTO the MOUNTAIN.

GIMLI
That road there - where does that lead?

LEGOLAS
It is the road to the Dimholt... The door
under the mountain.

EOMER
None who venture there ever return.

That mountain is evil...

... before him a HORSE whinnies and pulls at his ropes
nervously...

ARAGORN POV: A GHOSTLY FIGURE seems to emerge from the gloom
... ARAGORN starts in fright as...

GIMLI
Aragorn!

GIMLI
Let's find some food.

ARAGORN casts another look back at the ANCIENT STANDING
STONES before following GIMLI.

STRAP.

EOWYN
There! A true Esquire of Rohan.

MERRY exhales - excited and terrified in equal measure. In
his EXCITEMENT, he draws his SWORD...

EOWYN steps back, laughing...

MERRY
Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous.

It isn't even sharp.

EOWYN
Well, that's no good. You won't kill many
Orcs with a blunt blade. Come on.

As EOWYN and MERRY leave the tent, EOMER and GAMLING are
sitting nearby, finishing a meal... EOWYN ushers MERRY off.

EOWYN
To the Smith. Go!

EOMER
You should not encourage him.

EOWYN
And you should not doubt him.

EOMER
I do not doubt his heart... Only the reach
of his arm.

EOWYN
Why should Merry be left behind? He has as
much cause to go to war as you.

Why can he not fight for those he loves?

PRECIPICE as a HORSE and RIDER move along the RIDGE...

ZAG TRACK leading up to the PLATEAU...

and voices...

GANDALF
Look to the Black Ships...

In ARAGORN'S dream ARWEN suddenly WAKES...

ARWEN
I choose a mortal life... I wish I could
have seen him, one last time...

As ARWEN lies dying, the EVENSTAR falls from her fingers...
At that moment, ARAGORN wakes, his SWORD quickly in his HAND
... A GUARD stands in the DOORWAY...

GUARD
King Theoden awaits you, my Lord.

ARAGORN hurries towards THEODEN'S TENT...

THEODEN
I take my leave.

LEAVES, shooting ARAGORN a strange look as he goes...

reveal... ELROND.

ARAGORN
My Lord, Elrond.

ELROND
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

ELROND'S face is ETCHED with PAIN...

ELROND
Arwen is dying.

ARAGORN
She stayed?

ELROND
She will not long survive the evil that now
spreads from Mordor.

ELROND'S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around
ARAGORN'S neck...

ELROND
The light of the Evenstar is failing. As
Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the
end has come.

ARAGORN
It will not be our end, but his.

ELROND
You ride to war, but not to victory.
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -
this you know - but in secret he sends
another force which will attack from the
river...

ELROND
A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the
South.

ELROND
They will be in the city in two days...
You're out-numbered, Aragorn. You need more
men.

ARAGORN
There are none.

ELROND hesitates a BEAT...

ELROND

There are those who dwell in the mountain.

A SUDDEN WIND rushes through the TENT, lifting HANGINGS,
scattering MAPS, knocking over GOBLETS...

As ARAGORN looks at ELROND, an IMAGE FLASHES in his MIND'S
EYE... The GHOSTLY FIGURE on the DIMHOLT ROAD...

ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock...

ARAGORN
Murderers, traitors - you would call upon
them to fight? They believe in nothing.
They answer to no-one.

ELROND
They will answer to the King of Condor.

ARAGORN' S eyes fall to a PLAIN BLACK SCABBARD, which ELROND
draws from beneath his robes.

SWORD from the scabbard to reveal... a ELVEN SWORD glints in
the firelight!

ELROND
Anduril, flame of the West... forged from
the shards of Narsil.

ARAGORN takes the sword... staring at it in wonder.

ARAGORN
Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of
Elendil...

ARAGORN draws the long blade from its sheath...

A RAG OR N 
... the blade that was broken shall return
to Minas Tirith.

ELROND
The man who can wield the power of this
sword can summon to him an army more deadly
than any that walks this earth.

ELROND stares hard at ARAGORN...

ELROND
Put aside the Ranger - become who you were
born to be - take the Dimhplt Road.

A HEAVY SILENCE hangs in the room.

EOWYN
Why are you doing this?

ARAGORN looks over his shoulder at her...

EOWYN
The war lies to.the East. You cannot leave
on the eve of battle. You cannot abandon ;
the men.

ARAGORN
Eowyn...

· EOWYN
We need you here - ,

ARAGORN rounds on her...

ARAGORN
Why have you come?

EOWYN

Do you not know?

ARAGORN looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her.

ARAGORN

It is but a shadow and a thought that you
love... I cannot give you what you seek.

EOWYN steps back at though STRUCK... she watches stricken as

GIMLI
And just where do you think you're off to?

ARAGORN looks at GIMLI - GRATEFUL for his COURAGE but
determined to go ALONE.

ARAGORN
Not this time... This time you must stay,
my friend.

LEGOLAS
Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness
of Dwarves?

GIMLI steps closer to ARAGORN.

GIMLI
You might as well accept it - we're going

ARAGORN shakes his head, smiling his acceptance.

towards the BACK of the PLATEAU... Past the ANCIENT
STANDING STONES that lead to the NARROW PASS.

ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI... ROHAN SOLDIERS emerge from
their tents, crestfallen to see ARAGORN leave.

ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI disappear into the SHADOWS of the
MOUNTAINS. The ROHAN SOLDIERS murmur among themselves,
"What's happening?", "Where's he going?"

GAMLING
Lord Aragorn!

ROHAN SOLDIER
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

GAMLING
He leaves because there is no hope.

THEODEN
He leaves because he must.

GAMLING
Too few have come. We cannot defeat the
armies of Mordor.

THEODEN
No, we cannot...

But we will meet them in battle,
nonetheless.

before the MEN depart for WAR...

THEODEN

I have left instruction: the people are to
follow your rule in my stead... take up my
seat in the Golden Hall... long may you
defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.

She speaks without emotion.

EOWYN
What other duty would you have me do, my
Lord?

THEODEN moves towards her, taking up her HAND...

THEODEN

Duty?... No, I would have you smile again -
not grieve for those whose time has come.

EOWYN slowly lifts her head...

THEODEN
You shall live to see these days renewed.

THEODEN

No more despair.

GLOOMY CANYON, shadowed by BLACK FIR TREES. The shadowed
ridges of the DWIMORBERG MOUNTAIN rise BEFORE THEM.

It is a SPOOKY PLACE.

GIMLI
What kind of an army would linger in such a
place?

LEGOLAS
One that is cursed... Long ago the Men of
the Mountain swore an oath to the last King
of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight,
but when the time came, when Condor's need
was dire, they fled... Vanishing into the
darkness of the mountain... And so Isildur
cursed them - never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

SILENCE surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. Only the
OMINOUSLY MUFFLED THUD of their horses hooves on the dank FIR-
NEEDLES. '

GIMLI

The very warmth of my blood seems stolen
away.

Within the walls, a creepy DARK DOOR gapes like a mouth of
night. SIGNS and FIGURES are carved above its WIDE ARCH.

LEGOLAS

The way is shut. It was made by those who
are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is
shut.

AT THAT MOMENT: A CHILL WIND seems to rush out of the DOORWAY
... ARAGORN stares into the BLACKNESS, his HAIR BLOWING
WILDLY. The HORSES REAR and'BUCK'in terror, turning and
GALLOPING AWAY.

ARAGORN
Brego!

The three HORSES DISAPPEAR... ARAGORN turns resolutely
towards the DOORWAY...

ARAGORN

I do not fear death...

LEGOLAS quickly follows... swallowed by the DARKNESS.

FEAR.

GIMLI
Well, this is a thing unheard of... An Elf
will go underground when a Dwarf dare not.

Oh! I'd never hear the end of it!

GIMLI plunges into the TUNNEL behind the OTHERS!

MUCH ACTIVITY... HORNS SOUND... the ENTIRE CAMP is on the
MOVE... fires are DOUSED, TENTS pulled down, HORSES saddled.

THEODEN
We must ride light and swift. It's a long
road ahead... and man and beast must reach
the end with the strength to fight.

SUPPLIES. He is wearing an OVERSIZED HELMET and ROHIRRIM
CLOTHING... he looks at once NERVOUS and EXCITED.

KING THEODEN breaks away from a COLUMN and rides up to MERRY.

THEODEN

Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master
Meriadoc!

MERRY
All my friends have gone to battle. I would
be ashamed to be left behind!

THEODEN
It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith.
None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.

MERRY
But... I want to fight!

THEODEN
I will say no more.

KING THEODEN wheels his HORSE away...

MERRY is bitterly DISAPPOINTED. He stands, head down - a TINY
DEJECTED FIGURE - as the MIGHTY ROHIRRIM on their LARGE
HORSES ride by... a jangling sea of HELMETS, SHIELDS and
BANNERS.

As the ORC swarm from the TOWER, GANDALF realises PIPPIN has
come down from the CITADEL...

GANDALF
Peregrin Took! Go back to the citadel!

PIPPIN
They called us out to fight...

GANDALF
This is no place for a Hobbit!

GANDALF welds his STAFF, cutting through the attacking ORC
with EASE... BEHIND him, an ORC prepares to cut down GANDALF

GANDALF

The LANTERN LIG HT throws great SHADOWS upon the SHROUDED
WALLS of a wide VAULTED CHAMBER. ROW upon ROW of MARBLE TOMBS
are visible in the DIM LIGHT. Upon each TOMB lies a SLEEPING
FORM, carved in STONE, hands folded.

DENETHOR speaks in a HUSHED VOICE...

DENETHOR

No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long
slow sleep of death embalmed... we shall
burn - like the heathen kings of old!

The SERVANTS place FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY on a STONE
TABLE in the centre of the CHAMBER. They stand, heads bowed
... as MOURNERS beside a bed of death.

DENETHOR turns to his SERVANTS.

DENETHOR

PIPPIN
No! No! No! He's not dead. No!

DENETHOR

Farewell Peregrin, son of Paladin... I

DENETHOR throws PIPPIN outside!

DENETHOR

DENETHOR SLAMS the DOOR SHUT!

GANDALF
Pull back - to the second level! Hurry! Get

PIPPIN desperately pushes against the TIDE of SOLDIERS
retreating from the FIGHTING.

GOTHMOG turns to his SECOND LIEUTENANT...

GOTHMOG
Move into the city... Kill all in your

As ORC run through the STREETS, MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN flee

GANDALF

GANDALF pulls PIPPIN onto SHADOWFAX.

GANDALF
Come! Quickly!

The ROHAN charge is decimating the ENEMY!

LOW ANGLE POV: DENETHOR standing on the table astride
FARAMIR, pouring OIL over his OWN HEAD... It runs through
his hair and down his face, quickly soaking his ROBES.

through his delirium, OIL splashes onto his CHEST and FACE.

DENETHOR ,-
Set a fire in our flesh!

BUNDLES of OIL-SOAKED wood are STACKED all around them.

SERVANTS are holding FLAMING TORCHES, awaiting their orders
... DENETHOR nods to them:

The SERVANTS approach the PYRE, TORCHES held firmly.

AT THAT MOMENT: GANDALF and PIPPIN burst into the HALLOWS,
astride SHADOWFAX!

GANDALF

Stay this madness!

The fearful SERVANTS back away from the PYRE...

and HURLS it at the PYRE!

WHOOSH! The PYRE IGNITES!

PYRE!

With a desperate strength, PIPPIN pushes FARAMIR off the
BURNING PYRE... they tumble down the BUNDLES of WOOD, onto
the FLOOR! PIPPIN douses FLAMES on FARAMIR'S clothing.

DENETHOR SCREAMS with RAGE!

DENETHOR
No! Do not take my son from me!

DENETHOR leaps ACROSS THE PYRE, RIPPING and TUGGING at
PIPPIN! FIRE quickly spreads up DENETHOR'S OIL-SOAKED BACK as
he hauls PIPPIN off FARAMIR!

BRIEF MOMENT SANITY returns.

DENETHOR

Faramir...

HORROR as...

unguided BALL OF FLAME, he runs across the CHAMBER,
disappearing out of the door!

So passes Denethor, Son of Ecthelion.

DENETHOR runs across the WHITE COURT atop MINAS TIRITH...

ARAGORN walks slowly across the FIELD OF BATTLE towards the
HIDEOUS GHOULS...

KING OF THE DEAD

KING OF THE DEAD
You gave us your word.

I hold your oath fulfilled... Go. Be at

ARAGORN turns to GANDALF who bows his head in HOMAGE...

PIPPIN, in his GONDORIAN armour, looks around at the
devastation... his eyes full of SADNESS... they suddenly
fix on something.

towards a SMALL FIGURE slumped on the ground...

PIPPIN
Merry...?

MERRY stares unseeing at PIPPIN... HORROR and SHOCK erasing
all other memories from MERRY'S mind... tears fall down
PIPPIN'S FACE as he looks on his FRIEND...

PIPPIN
Merry... it's me, it's Pippin...

MERRY

I knew you'd find me.

Are you going to leave me?

PIPPIN
No Merry, I'm going to look after you.

CAMERA RISES... towards the dark ORC TOWER of CIRITH UNGOL.
A light glows from the TOPMOST WINDOW.

CAMERA reaches the TOWER, dissolving through the wall into...

... a small cold ROOM. FRODO BAGGINS is UNCONSCIOUS on the
floor. His eyes suddenly flicker and he WAKES UP.

TILT UP... to reveal the ORC and URUK-HAI, GORBAG and
SHAGRAT, arguing over FRODO'S BELONGINGS and CLOTHES! GORBAG
is snatching for the MITHRIL VEST.

SHAGRAT
Hey! Hands off - that shiny shirt, that's
mine.

GORBAG
It's going to the Great Eye, along with
everything else...

ANGLE ON... FRODO as he realizes that he has been STRIPPED
down to his UNDERWEAR. He clutches at his throat.

... The RING HAS GONE!

SHAGRAT
I don't take orders from stinking Morgul
rats!

GORBAG grabs for the MITHRIL VEST...

GORBAG

You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in
your guts!

BACKWARDS with his foot! GORBAG FALLS THROUGH a TRAP DOOR
leading to the floor below!

creating SUDDEN ALARM amongst the ORCS and URUK-HAI stationed
there.

SHAGRAT leans through the TRAP DOOR...

SHAGRAT

The scum tried to knife me! Kill him!

SEVERAL URUK-HAI converge on GORBAG - he LASHES OUT, slashing
one across the throat with his SWORD!

The DEAD URUK-HAI topples backwards over the PARAPET...

... landing on top of URUK-HAI and ORCS in the courtyard
below. Within moments, a brutal CIVIL WAR breaks out between
the TWO COMPANIES stationed in CIRITH UNGOL!

SAM is confronted with the sight of over 50 SLAUGHTERED ORC
and URUK-HAI, strewn over the COURTYARD!

SEVERAL URUK-HAI are running DOWN TOWARDS HIM! He grips STING
and continues CHARGING UP - SCREAMING at the top of his
lungs!

on the wall in front of them! They turn around and flee in
terror back to the top of the stairs!

SAM appears - and before the URUK-HAI can fully regain their
wits - he slays THREE... YELLING:

SAM

That's for Frodo!

And for the Shire!

And that's for my old Gaffer!

SAM runs into the TOWER...

climbs back into the room... with VENGEANCE in his EVIL
EYES.

GORBAG
Stop your squeaking you dunghill rat!

exposing his neck. He pulls out his SWORD, ready to cut
FRODO'S throat...

GORBAG
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig!

SUDDENLY! GORBAG GASPS as STING is rammed into his back by
SAM!

SAM
Not if I stick you first!

GORBAG falls dead!

FRODO

Sam!!!

FRODO
Oh, Sam... I'm so sorry... sorry for
everything.

SAM quickly cuts FRODO free.

SAM
Come on.

FRODO

It's too late. It's over... they've taken
it. Sam - they took the Ring!!

SAM

Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

SAM pulls the RING from his pocket...

SAM
I thought I'd lost you... so I took it -
only for safe-keeping.

FRODO
Give it to me.

FRODO
Give me the Ring, Sam.

SAM seems strangely reluctant... ON THE SOUNDTRACK to HUM of

FRODO
Sam! Give me the Ring.

FRODO
You must understand... The Ring is my
burden... it will destroy you, Sam.

FRODO looks at SAM, pain in his eyes...

SAM looks down at FRODO... his plain HOBBIT face full of
compassion. SAM'S resolve hardens, a new strength takes hold.

SAM
Come on, Mr Frodo, we'd best find you some
clothes... you can't go walking through
Mordor in naught but your skin.

FRODO and SAM are now dressed in FOUL-LOOKING ORC gear...

CIRITH UNGOL... into MORDOR.

and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of
MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH.

With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep
path into the dark kingdom...

... TWO TINY FIGURES in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before
them lies the PLAIN of GORGOROTH... Their eyes are drawn to
the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE of MOUNT DOOM...

SAM
We did it, Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor.

FRODO
There are so many of them. So many.
We'll never get through unseen.

FRODO
It's him - the Eye.

The GREAT EYE OF SAURON!

SAM cannot see what FRODO sees. GENTLY, he urges FRODO on.

SAM
We have to go in there, Mr Frodo. There's
nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

alone... he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice.

GANDALF
Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The
darkness is deepening.

He turns and crosses the HALL to reveal the presence of
GIMLI, LEGOLAS, EOMER and ARAGORN...

ARAGORN, his back to GANDALF...

ARAGORN
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

GANDALF
It's only a matter of time. He has suffered
a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of
Mordor our enemy is regrouping.

GIMLI sits insolently on the SEAT of the STEWARD...

GIMLI
Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should
we care?

GANDALF looks across at the DWARF... His face ashen.

GANDALF
Because ten thousand Orcs now stand between
Frodo and Mount Doom.

GANDALF

I have sent him to his death.

ARAGORN
No.

GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN...

ARAGORN
There is still hope for Frodo. He needs
time and safe passage across the Plains of
Gorgoroth. We can give him that.

GANDALF
How?

ARAGORN
Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands.
Then we gather our full strength and march
on the Black Gate.

At this, GIMLI CHOKES on his pipe... EOMER steps forward.

EOMER
We cannot achieve victory from strength of
arms.

ARAGORN
Not for ourselves. But we can give Frodo
his chance if we keep Sauron's eye fixed
upon us. Keep him blind to all else that
moves.

LEGOLAS
A diversion...

GANDALF
Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not
take the bait!

GIMLI
Certainty of death. Small chance of
success. What are we waiting for?

STOP

SAM
Look, the Orcs! They're moving off. You
see, Mr Frodo - some luck at last.

FRODO and SAM... moving across a HELLISH dry landscape of
twisted volcanic rock and STEAMING FISSURES.

40 MILES AWAY, MOUNT DOOM rises out of the PLAIN... its feet
founded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great
height, where its reeking head is swathed in cloud.

ARAGORN'S FORCE of 500 approaches the great BLACK GATES OF
MORDOR. He positions his troops about half a mile from the
GATES.

from his WATER BOTTLE... but finds it EMPTY.

SAM
Take mine... there's a few drops left.

FRODO gratefully takes a SMALL SIP from SAM'S BOTTLE...
hands it back.

FRODO
There'll be none left for the return
journey.

SAM

I don't think there will be a return
journey, Mr Frodo.

A moment of EYE CONTACT between FRODO and SAM as they
acknowledge what lies ahead.

SAM offers FRODO his hand... and PULLS HIM UP.

At the BLACK GATES, ARAGORN musters his MEN...

WIDE ON: FRODO and SAM staggering across the TORTURED
LANDSCAPE... they are no longer WEARING the ORC ARMOUR.

if his eyes not longer see the way before his feet.

His right HAND is pressed against his CHEST... supporting a
HEAVY WEIGHT. His left HAND often rises, as if to ward off
some invisible blow. SAM watches him, CONCERN etched across
his FACE...

him... "Baggins - Baggins"...

WIDE ON: A RAY of RED LIGHT stabs through the GLOOM and
begins to sweep over the BARREN LANDSCAPE...

SAM
Fo o g td w
rd , e on

SAM throws himself to the ground... FRODO turns to the
light, unable to stop himself...

FRODO crumpling to the ground as the RED LIGHT hits him like
a SEARCHLIGHT.

All is QUIET... No sign of the ENEMY...

PIPPIN

Where are they?

WIDE: ARAGORN, GANDALF, LEGOLAS, GIMLI, EOMER, MERRY and
PIPPIN galloping towards the BLACK GATES. They pull up less
than 50 yards from the TOWERING GATES...

FRODO is slumped on the GROUND, unable to MOVE...

ARAGORN
Let the lord of the Black Land come forth;
let justice be done upon him.

From behind the HUGE GATES, the terrifying CHANTING and the
CLANGING of the ARMOUR of THOUSANDS...

With the SOUND of TORTURED METAL, the MASSIVE GATES begin to
open... LEGOLAS, MERRY and EOMER look on in trepidation.

With the EYE OF SAURON sweeping the PLAINS around them, SAM
gets to his feet...

The BLACK GATES of MORDOR SWING OPEN! SAURON'S ARMY of
300,000 ORCS MARCH OUT!

ARAGORN
Pull back! Pull back!

PIPPIN GALLOP back towards their SMALL ARMY as the ORC MASSES
slowly MARCH toward them.

Behind them, the EYE OF SAURON is directed toward THEM...

FRODO'S eyes open with a START...

SAM
It's gone, Mr Frodo.

SAM
The light's passed on, away towards the
North... something's drawn it's gaze.

FRODO and SAM stagger to their feet and move off.

MEN.

ENCIRCLE THEM. SOME MEN are backing away... losing their
nerve.

ARAGORN GALLOPS in front of his ARMY...

ARAGORN
Hold your ground - hold your ground! Sons
of Gondor - of Rohan... my brothers!

his MEN with his eyes.

ARAGORN
I see in your eyes the same fear that would
take the heart of me. The day may come when
the courage of Men fails; when we forsake
our friends and break all bonds of
fellowship; but it is not this day - an
hour of wolves and shattered shields, when
the Age of Man comes crashing down - but it
is not this day!!! This day we fight! By
all that you hold dear on this good earth -
I bid you stand!

ARAGORN holds ANDURIL ALOFT!

ARAGORN
Men of the West!

FRODO and SAM are CLIMBING the face of MOUNT DOOM...

The LANDSCAPE is VIOLENT... RED HEAT hisses out of FISSURES,
the ROCK is JAGGED... RAZOR SHARP... ASH blankets the LAND.

RED LIGHTNING FORKS across the SKY with a DEAFENING CRACK!.

Their PARCHED LIPS... SWEATING, DUSTY FACES.

FRODO TRIPS... falls FACE-FIRST into the DUST... SAM drops
beside him.

HIGH WIDE: Of ARAGORN'S ARMY, totally SURROUNDED by 300,000
ORCS... poised for the order to ATTACK!

FRODO starts to CRAWL on his HANDS and KNEES! He hauls
himself a FEW PITIFUL FEET before SLUMPING in the ASH.

STOP

GIMLI
Never thought I'd die fighting side by side
with an Elf.

LEGOLAS
What about side by side with a friend?

GIMLI
Aye, I could do that.

LEGOLAS drops his hand on GIMLI'S shoulder... SLOWLY they
turn and FACE the ENEMY TOGETHER.

rock-face... he turns him over, holding him in his ARMS.

SAM

Do you remember the Shire, Mr Frodo?
... It'll be spring soon, and the orchards
will be in blossom; and the birds will be
nesting in the hazel thicket; and they'11
be sowing the summer barley in the lower
fields; and eating the first of the
strawberries with cream.

Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

FRODO

No, Sam. I can't recall the taste of food;
nor the sound of water; nor the touch of
grass... I'm naked in the dark.

There's no veil between me and the wheel of
fire. I can see it with my waking eyes.

SAM
Then let us be rid of it - once and for
all! Come on, Mr Frodo. I can't carry it
for you... but I can carry you! Come on!

With that, SAM lifts FRODO on to his shoulders and starts to
CLIMB MOUNT DOOM! His plain hobbit-face grows stern, almost
grim, as the will hardens in him.

WIDE ON: TWO TINY HOBBITS on the ENDLESS shale SLOPES of the
MOUNTAIN...

a tide of ORCS...

ARAGORN raises ANDURIL in the BROAD SWEEP as he walks forward
... he turns to FACE the OTHERS...

into the EYES of the remaining members of the FELLOWSHIP...

ARAGORN

For Frodo...

There is a moment of SILENCE... no-one else moves...
SUDDENLY a SHOUT goes up!

the MEN following...

ORCS!

WIDE: Like a small grey insect, SAM creeps up the slope with
FRODO on his back... foot by foot.

The mantling CLOUD swirls, revealing the cruel pinnacles and
iron crown of BARAD-DUR, the Dark Tower, in the distance.

laden WINDS are buffeting him as he slowly CLIMBS MOUNT DOOM.

The PLAIN of GORGOROTH lies 1000 FEET BELOW, wrapped in fume
and shadow.

A TREMOR ripples through the GROUND... a RED FLAME explodes
into the SKY...

at any moment!

SAM POV: Through the THICK, FUME-LADEN AIR a set of STAIRS
can be made out...

SAM

Look, Mr Frodo! We're almost there! -.-.

SAM can't believe it - relief and joy flood through him...

GOLLUM
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

SMACK!. OUT OF NOWHERE the figure of SMEAGOL crashes into them
sending SAM and FRODO sprawling.

around his throat, snapping FRODO'S neck from side to side!

FINGERS around his neck but SMEAGOL'S grip is too strong.

squeezing the life out of him...

WHACK! A ROCK connects with the SIDE of SMEAGOL'S head...

The BATTLE between MEN and ORCS rages on... From MORDOR,
high OVERHEAD, the NAZGUL fly out into the FRAY...

All the old HATRED between SAM and SMEAGOL boils over as they
FIGHT... SAM falls back... SMEAGOL BITING at his SHOULDER!
SAM pushes SMEAGOL away with his feet... rolls to his KNEES,
as SMEAGOL charges at him...

SAM slashes out with STING! He cuts SMEAGOL across the
stomach! SMEAGOL staggers back, SCREAMING with PAIN...

SAM looks around desperately for FRODO...

SAM

Frodo!

FRODO has GONE!

FELLOWSHIP fight BRAVELY... a hideous screech rends the AIR!

across his line of sight.

Another cry rends the air as...

SMACK! The GIANT EAGLE, GWAHIR, SMASHES into the FELLBEAST,
it's claws ripping into the HIDEOUS MONSTER'S NECK!

PIPPIN

Eagles...

Above the BATTLE attack formation, more EAGLES appear...

... PIPPIN
The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming!

The EAGLES engage the NAZGUL!

the SLOPES of MOUNT DOOM searching for FRODO.

... leading into the MOUNTAIN!

SAM staggers into it!

the TUNNEL.

SAM

Frodo!

SAM lurches forward... towards an ORANGE GLOW deep in the
HEART of the MOUNTAIN.

The HEAT is almost UNBEARABLE... SAM sees FRODO in the
DISTANCE...

FRODO
I'm here, Sam.

... a deep LAVA FILLED CHASM, in the very heart of ancient
SAURON'S FORGES, the greatest in Middle-earth.

The RAGING ORANGE GLARE from the CHASM turns FRODO into a
BLACK SILHOUETTE... standing TENSE and STILL.

FRODO holds the RING in his HAND... he RAISES IT, holding
it over the BUBBLING LAVA far below.-

SAM

Destroy it - go on! Throw it in the fire!

SAM
What are you waiting for? Just let it go!

ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The HUM of the RING grows louder and
louder! FRODO PULLS the RING close to his body as he turns to
SAM.

FRODO looks at SAM, the RING has finally taken him.

FRODO
The Ring is mine.

SAM SCREAMS as...

... FRODO PUTS THE RING ON! He VANISHES!

SAM
No! :

With a storm of wings, the NAZGUL wheel around and hurtle
towards MOUNT DOOM!

In the midst of the BATTLE - GANDALF... realising FRODO has
been seen...

FLOOR!

SUDDENLY! GOLLUM smashes a ROCK down on SAM'S HEAD, knocking
him to the GROUND!

GOLLUM LEAPS on to the INVISIBLE FRODO!

GOLLUM'S WEIGHT!

the INVISIBLE FRODO...

ARAGORN turns and is confronted by an ARMOURED TROLL,
wielding an ENORMOUS MALLET...

GOLLUM suddenly LIFTS HIS HANDS to his face... and BITES
HARD!

clutching his BLEEDING HAND... he SCREAMS.

The FIRES below roar in anger, RED LIGHT blazes, and all the
cavern is filled with a great glare and heat.

ECSTATIC!

the EDGE OF THE CHASM!

ARAGORN turns to see HUGE TROLL FEET moving CLOSER...
LEGOLAS races toward him...

GOLLUM still TRIUMPHANT... on the edge of the PRECIPICE...
The FIERY LAVA casting an EVIL LIGHT... He jumps about in
DELIGHT...

GOLLUM
Precious! Precious!

time seems to stand still as each regards the other...

... POWERFUL... EVIL...

SUDDENLY! FRODO lunges at GOLLUM...

FRODO thuds into GOLLUM, lifting him off his feet...

the EDGE OF THE CHASM.

THUD! The HUGE FOOT of the CAVE TROLL lands on ARAGORN'S
chest. He STABS at. it ineffectually...

SAM watches in HORROR as FRODO and GOLLUM... disappear into
the CHASM! He staggers over...

SLOW MOTION: GOLLUM falls into the CRACK OF DOOM...
INSTANTLY engulfed in the CHURNING LAVA!

HAND!

The CAVERNS are SHAKING VIOLENTLY.

SAM desperately reaches for him... FRODO is too far down.

SAM
Give me your hand.

SAM
Take my hand!

FRODO struggles to reach SAM... he.can't reach WITH HIS
BLEEDING hand, and falls'back, still clinging valiantly to
the ROCK with his good hand...

SAM
No!

SAM
Don't you let go! Don't let go. Reach!

moment, then SINKS away...

WIDE ON: Across the GREAT PLAINS - MOUNT DOOM is clearly
IMPLODING...

On the BATTLEFIELD, all eyes turn to MOUNT DOOM...

distracted by the SOUNDS emanating from MORDOR... he turns
in TERROR and RUNS OFF...

TOWER of SAURON shakes itself to pieces!

TOWERS FALL and WALLS CRUMBLE; vast spires of SMOKE and
spouting STEAM billow up!

The FOUNDATIONS explode apart...

The BLACK GATES collapse in a huge cloud of ASH!

THE ORCS are FLEEING in all DIRECTIONS... As the very
foundations of MORDOR collapse!

THE COMPANY watch as MOUNT DOOM explodes... the reason for
their MISERY is clear... it's plain FRODO and SAM can never
survive the cataclysm...

The VOLCANO is ERUPTING, FIRE belches from it's riven summit,
sending LAVA streaming down it's sides..

... all around ASH and MOLTEN ROCKS fall. The SKIES burst
into THUNDER, seared with LIGHTNING.

The screaming NAZGUL fall from the sky in FLAMES!

The ground is shaking so violently that FRODO and SAM can
barely stand.

FRODO stumbles... SAM helps him up... FRODO smiles.

FRODO
It's gone. It's done.

SAM
Yes, Mr. Frodo. It's over now.

FRODO
I can see the Shire. The Brandywine
River, Bag End, Gandalf's fireworks, the
lights in the Party Tree.

SAM
Rosie Cotton dancing. She had ribbons in
her hair. If ever I was to marry someone, it
would have been her. It would have been
her.

FRODO
I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee.
here at the end of all things.

STOP

FRODO
Gandalf?

GANDALF'S face breaks into a smile... then laughter...

... as MERRY and PIPPIN run in... jumping on the bed and
hugging FRODO...

GIMLI and LEGOLAS enter the room... their joy is PLAIN...

ARAGORN joins them - the FELLOWSHIP is complete...

... finally FRODO'S eyes fall upon a FIGURE standing apart
from the others... it is SAM...

towards the TOP of the CITY... through a BLIZZARD of WHITE
FLOWER PETALS! MINAS TIRITH is restored... it gleams WHITE
in the BRIGHT SUN.

SOARING UP: to REVEAL the COURT OF THE KINGS, CROWDED with
4000 PEOPLE... cramming the WIDE PATH leading to the TOWER
HALL! ;

SUNSHINE...

GANDALF places the CROWN upon ARAGORN'S head.

GANDALF
Now come the days of the King...

ARAGORN smiles up at GANDALF...

GANDALF :

May they be blessed.

ARAGORN slowly RISES, turning to face the CROWD, who CHEER
and CLAP for their KING...

ARAGORN
This day does not belong to one man but to
all. Let us together rebuild this world
that we may share in the days of peace.

The CHEERS of his PEOPLE are DEAFENING...

ARAGORN sings for his people... Then WALKS in SLOW
PROCESSION down the WHITE PAVED PATH as the CROWD BOW their
heads in respect to their NEW KING...

ARAGORN passes EOWYN and FARAMIR who bow before him... EOMER
steps FORWARD to bow in respect...

TRUMPETS SOUND as a PROCESSION of ELVES, dressed in
shimmering SILVERS and WHITES, led by LEGOLAS approach the
KING... LEGOLAS gestures behind him...

CONDOR in FULL FLOWER... the RANKS of ELVES part revealing:

ARWEN, eyes shining... MORTAL now, but deeply in love...
carrying the STANDARD of CONDOR... ARAGORN kisses her

ELROND looks on... his face breaks into a smile.

ARAGORN and ARWEN embrace.

AVENUE...

PIPPIN, as they stand before them...

The FOUR HOBBITS, dressed in their OLD CLOTHES, clean and
mended, bow their heads...

ARAGORN raises his HAND.

ARAGORN
My friends... you bow to no-one.

HOBBITS, his head bowed... followed by all assembled there.

little Hobbits from the Shire.

CAMERA RISES INTO THE AIR... away from the CROWDED CITADEL,
until MINAS TIRITH becomes a SPECK in the LANDSCAPE...

DISSOLVING into the PARCHMENT MAP of MIDDLE-EARTH... Slowly
drifting across the MAP towards the WEST...

FRODO
And thus it was a Fourth Age of Middle-
earth began, and the Fellowship of the
Ring, though eternally bound by friendship
and love, was ended.
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf ,.
sent us on our long journey...

FRODO
... we found ourselves looking upon a
familiar sight... We were home!

MATCHING MOVE: Revealing HOBBITON bathed in a WARM SUNSET...
As FRODO, SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN ride into SHOT on PONIES...

their appearance.

FRODO brings a round of drinks to the TABLE.

Nearby a HUGE FUSS is being made of a LARGE PUMPKIN which has
been brought in to be shown off.

Seated at a long table, the FOUR FRIENDS raise their glasses
... SAM eye is suddenly caught!

SAM steels himself and leaves to go and TALK to ROSIE...

FRODO, MERRY and PIPPIN exchange smiles as...

On a BEAUTIFUL sunny day, SAM and ROSIE are MARRIED... With
their dearest FRIENDS gathered around them...

ROSIE throws a beautiful bouquet of FLOWERS... it's caught
by PIPPIN who smiles in embarrassment...

DISSOLVE TO:

FRODO walks through BAG END to his STUDY...

FRODO
How do you pick up the threads of an old
life? How do you go on, when in your heart
you begin to understand. There is no going
back. There are some things that time
cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep.
That have taken hold.

PUSH IN... to reveal BILBO'S RED BOOK open on FRODO'S DESK.
He is WRITING in the LAST CHAPTERS...

in careful neat HANDWRITING. FRODO turns back the pages,
REVEALING: There and Back Again - A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo
Baggins. He writes below it as SAM GAMGEE calls out from the
door:

SAM
Mr Frodo?

SAM
What is it?

FRODO
It's been four years to the day since
Weathertop, Sam. It's never really healed.

SAM
"There and Back Again. A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.
And The Lord of the Rings, by Frodo Baggins".
You've finished it!

FRODO
Not quite. There's room for a little more.

FRODO
Bilbo once told me, the great stories never
end - that each of us must come and go in
the telling. His part in this tale was now
over. There would be no more journeys for
Bilbo. Save one.

STOP

BILBO
Tell me again, lad. Where are we going?

FRODO
To the harbour, Bilbo. The Elves have
accorded you a special honour. A place on
the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

BILBO
Frodo, any chance of seeing that old
ring of mine? The one I gave you?

FRODO
Sorry, Uncle. I'm afraid, I lost it.

BILBO
Oh, pity. I should like to have held it
one last time.

BILBO
Oh! Well, here's a sight I have never·seen
before.

STOP

GALADRIEL
The power of the Three Rings is ended. The
time has come for the Dominion of Men.

ELROND
I Aear can ven na mar.
(The Sea calls us home.)

BILBO
I think I'm quite ready for another
adventure.

GANDALF
Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now
finished. Here at last, on the shores of
the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship.

GANDALF
I will not say: "do not weep", for not all
tears are an evil.

GANDALF
It is time, Frodo.

SAM
What does he mean?

FRODO
We set out to save the Shire, and it has
been saved. But not for me.

SAM
You don't mean that - you can't leave.

FRODO
The last pages are for you, Sam.

STOP

SAM
Elanor!

FRODO
My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in
two. You have to be one and whole for many
years. You have so much enjoy and to be and
to do. Because Sam, your part in the
journey goes on.

SAM
Hello, little Frodo!

SAM
Well... I'm back.
