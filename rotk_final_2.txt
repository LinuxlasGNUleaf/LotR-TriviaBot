DEAGOL
Smeagol, I've got one!
I've got a fish, Smeagol!

SMEAGOL
Go on, pull it in.

SMEAGOL
Deagol!

STOP

SMEAGOL
Give us that, Deagol, my love!

DEAGOL turns to look at him, a smirk on his face.

DEAGOL
Why?

SMEAGOL
Because its my birthday, and I wants it.

SMEAGOL
My precious!

STOP

SMEAGOL
They cursed us. Murderer. Murderer they
called us. They cursed us and drove us
away.

SMEAGOL
And we wept, Precious, we wept to be so
alone. And we forgot the taste of bread,
the sound of trees, the softness of the
wind. We even forgot our own name.
Gollum! Gollum!

GOLLUM
It's mine! My own. It came to me.

SMEAGOL
My Precious.

STOP

GOLLUM
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We
must go, yes, we must go at once!

SAM
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo?

SAM
I've gone and had too much!

SAM
It must be getting late.

FRODO
No, no it isn't. It isn't midday yet.
The days are growing darker.

GOLLUM
Come on, must go, no time!

SAM
Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.

GOLLUM
- no time to lose, silly!

SAM
Here.

FRODO
What about you?

SAM
I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas
bread.

FRODO
Sam.

SAM
Alright. We don't have that much left.
We have to be careful or we're going to run
out. You go ahead and eat that, Mr Frodo.
I've rationed it. There should be enough.

FRODO
For what?

SAM
The journey home.

STOP

GOLLUM
Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close
to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry!
Shhh.

STOP

PIPPIN
I feel like I'm back at the Green Dragon,
after a hard days work.

MERRY
Only, you've never done a hard days work.

STOP

MERRY
Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard.

GIMLI
You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led
us on, and now we find you feasting and
smoking.

PIPPIN
We are sitting on a field of victory,
enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
The salted pork is particularly good.

GIMLI
Salted pork?

GANDALF
Hobbits!

MERRY
We're under orders from Treebeard, who's
taken over management of Isengard.

STOP

TREEBEARD
Huraroom. Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad
you've come. Wood and water, stock and ,
stone I can master, but there's a wizard to
be managed here. Locked in his tower.

GANDALF
And there Saruman must remain, under your
guard, Treebeard.

GIMLI
Let's just have his head and be done with
it!

GANDALF
No. He has no power any more.

TREEBEARD
The filth of Saruman is washing away.
Trees will come back to live here, young
trees, wild trees.

STOP

TREEBEARD
Well bless my bark!

GANDALF
Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!
Quickly, now!

STOP

THEODEN
Tonight we remember those who gave their
blood to defend this country. Hail the
victorious dead!

EOWYN
Westu Aragorn hal.

STOP

THEODEN
I am happy for you.
He is an honourable man.

EOWYN
You are both honourable men.

THEODEN
It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our
people to victory.

THEODEN
Don't listen to me - you are young, and
tonight is for you.

MERRY & PIPPIN
Oh, you can search - up and down
As many lands as can be found
But you'll never find a beer so brown
As the one we drink in our home town
You can keep your fancy ales
You can drink them by the flagon
But the only brew, for the brave and true,
Comes from the Green Dragon!

ARAGORN
No news of Frodo?

GANDALF
No word, nothing.

ARAGORN
We still have time.

ARAGORN
Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

GANDALF
Do we know that?

ARAGORN
What does your heart tell you?

GANDALF
That Frodo is alive.

GANDALF
Yes. Yes, he is alive.

STOP

SMEAGOL
Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They
stole it from us. Kill them- kill them-
kill them both!

SMEAGOL
No!

GOLLUM
Shhh! Quiet!

GOLLUM
Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

SMEAGOL
They knows, they knows, they suspects us.
SMEAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER.

GOLLUM
What is it saying, my precious, my love?
Is Smeagol losing his nerve?

SMEAGOL :
No! Not! Never! Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses!
Smeagol wants to see them - dead!

GOLLUM
And we will. Smeagol did it once -
He can do it again.

SMEAGOL
We must get the Precious. We must get it
back.

GOLLUM
Patience, patience, my love. First we must
lead them to her.

SMEAGOL
We lead them to the windy stairs.

GOLLUM
Yes, the stairs. And then?

SMEAGOL
Up, up, up, up the stairs we go, until
we come to - the Tunnel!

GOLLUM
And when they go in, there's no coming out.
She's always hungry, she always needs to
feed. She must eat, all she gets is filthy
Orcses.

SMEAGOL
And they doesn't taste very nice, does
they, Precious?

GOLLUM
No, not very nice at all, my love. She
hungers for sweeter meats.

GOLLUM
"Hobbit meat." And when She throws away the
bones and the empty clothes, then we will
find it.

SMEAGOL
And take it for Me!

GOLLUM
For us-

SMEAGOL
Yes, we, we meant for us.
Gollum! Gollum!

GOLLUM
The Precious will be ours once the
Hobbitses are dead!

SAM
You treacherous little toad!

GOLLUM
No! Not! Help! Master!

FRODO
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

SAM
I heard it from his own mouth he means
to murder us!

SMEAGOL
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly!
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol
and who makes up nasty lies!

SAM
You miserable little maggot! I'll stove
your head in!

FRODO
Sam!

SAM
Call me a liar! You're a liar!

FRODO
Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost.

SAM
I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I
won't wait around for him to kill us!

FRODO
I'm not sending him away.

SAM
You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!

FRODO
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not
without a guide. I need you on my side.

SAM
I'm on your side, Mr Frodo.

FRODO
I know, Sam, I know.
You must trust me.
Come, Smeagol.

STOP

LEGOLAS
The stars are veiled, something stirs in
the east. A sleepless malice.

LEGOLAS
The eye of the enemy is moving.

MERRY
What you doing?
Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?

MERRY
Pippin, are you mad?

PIPPIN
I just want to look at it. Just one more
time.

MERRY
Put it back! Put - it - back!

LEGOLAS
He is here!

MERRY
Help! Someone help him!

STOP

GANDALF
Fool of a Took!

PIPPIN
Gandalf! Forgive me.

GANDALF
Look at me! What did you see?

PIPPIN
A tree. There was a white tree in a
courtyard of stone. It was dead!

PIPPIN
The city was burning.

GANDALF
Minas Tirith?
Is that what you saw?

PIPPIN
I saw- I saw him. I could hear his voice in my head.

GANDALF
And what did you tell him? Speak!

PIPPIN
He asked me my name, I didn't answer. He hurt me-

GANDALF
What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?

STOP

GANDALF
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool,
but an honest fool he remains. He told
Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

GANDALF
We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
enemy's plan.

GANDALF
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
our enemy one thing.

GANDALF
The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
not as weak as he supposed. There is
courage still - strength enough left to
challenge him.

GANDALF
Sauron fears this. He will not risk the
peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one
banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the
ground before he sees the return of the King.

GANDALF
If the beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan
must be ready for war!

THEODEN
Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of
those who did not come to ours?

THEODEN
What do we owe Gondor?

ARAGORN
I will go.

GANDALF
No!

ARAGORN
They must be warned.

GANDALF
They will be.

GANDALF
You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.
Follow the river, look to the black ships.

GANDALF
Understand this: Things are now in
motion that cannot be undone.

GANDALF
I ride for Minas Tirith! And I won't be
going alone!

STOP

GANDALF
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin,
Took, you are the worst. Hurry, hurry!

PIPPIN
Where are we going?

MERRY
Why did you look - why do you always have
to look?

PIPPIN
I don't know, I can't help it.

MERRY
You never can.

PIPPIN
I'm sorry, alright? I won't do it again.

MERRY
Don't you understand! The Enemy thinks
you have the Ring. He's going to be
looking for you, Pip. They have to get you
out of here!

PIPPIN
And you. You're coming with me-
Merry?

MERRY
Come on!

PIPPIN
How far is Minas Tirith?

GANDALF
Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and
you'd better hope we don't have one of
those on our tail.

MERRY
Here - something for the road.

PIPPIN
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

MERRY
I know you've run out. You smoke too
much, Pip.

PIPPIN
But we'll see each other soon?
Won't we?

MERRY
I don't know. I don't know what's going to happen.

GANDALF
Run Shadowfax, show us the meaning of
haste.

PIPPIN
Merry!

STOP

ELROND
Take her by the safest road. A ship lies
anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to
carry her across the Sea. The last
journey of Arwen Undomiel.

ELROND
Arwen, there is nothing for you here. Only death.

ELF ESCORT
Lady Arwen?
We cannot delay.

ELF ESCORT
My Lady!

STOP

ARWEN
What did you see?

ELROND
Arwen?

ARWEN
You have the gift of foresight - tell me
what you have seen.

ELROND
I looked into your future and I saw death.

ARWEN
There is also life.

ARWEN
You saw there was a child. You saw my son.

ELROND
That future is almost gone.

ARWEN
But it is not lost.

ELROND
Nothing is certain.

ARWEN
Some things are certain. If I leave him now
I will regret It forever.
Ada, it is time.

ARWEN
From the ashes of fire shall be woken,
a light from the shadow shall spring,
renewed shall be blade that was broken.
The crownless again shall be King.

ARWEN
Reforge the sword.

ARWEN
Ada.

ELROND
Your hands are cold.
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
It has begun.

ARWEN
This was my choice, Ada. Whether by your
will or not, there is no ship now that can
bear me hence.

STOP

GANDALF
We have just passed into the realm of
Gondor!

GANDALF
Minas Tirith. City of the Kings.

STOP

PIPPIN
It's the tree, Gandalf. Gandalf!

GANDALF
Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of
the King.

GANDALF
Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He
is a steward only. A caretaker of the
throne.

GANDALF
Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
Boromir's father. To give him news of his
beloved son's death would be most unwise.
And do not mention Frodo. Or the Ring.
And say nothing of Aragorn either-
In fact, it's better if you don't speak at
all, Pippin Took.

STOP

GANDALF
Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
Steward of Gondor.

GANDALF
I come with tidings in this dark hour - and
with counsel.

DENETHOR
Perhaps you come to explain this?

DENETHOR
Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is
dead?

PIPPIN
Boromir died to save us. My kinsman and
me. He fell, defending us from many foes.

GANDALF
Pippin!

PIPPIN
I offer you my service, such as it is, in
payment of this debt.

GANDALF
Get up!

GANDALF
My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming.
The Enemy is on your doorstep. As Steward, 
you are charged with the defence of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

GANDALF
You still have friends - you are not alone
in this fight. Send word to Theoden of
Rohan. Light the beacons.

DENETHOR
You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for
all your subtleties, you have not wisdom. Do
you think the eyes of the White Tower are
blind? I have seen more than you know. With
your left hand you would use me as a shield
against Mordor and with your right you
would seek to supplant me.

DENETHOR
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,
yes. Word has reached my ears of this
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
North - last of a ragged house, long bereft
of Lordship.

GANDALF
Authority is not given to you to deny the
return of the King - Steward!

DENETHOR
The rule of Gondor is mine, and no others!

GANDALF
Come.

STOP

PIPPIN
So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial
position. I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting, do they?

GANDALF
You're in the service of the Steward now.
You're going to have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took.

GANDALF
Guard of the Citadel!

PIPPIN
It's so quiet.

GANDALF
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

PIPPIN
I don't want to be in a battle, but
waiting on the edge of one I can't escape
is even worse.
Is there any hope, Gandalf - for Frodo and
Sam?

GANDALF
There never was much hope.

GANDALF
Just a fool's hope.

GANDALF
Our enemy is almost ready, his full
strength gathered. Not only Orcs, but men
as well.

GANDALF
Legions of Haradrim from the South.

GANDALF
Mercenaries from the coast. All will
answer Mordor's call.

GANDALF
This will be the end of Gondor as we know
it. Here the hammerstroke will fall
hardest.

GANDALF
If the river is taken, if the garrison at
Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this
city will be gone.

PIPPIN
But we have the White Wizard. That's got to
count for something.

PIPPIN
Gandalf?

GANDALF
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest
servant. The one who will lead Mordor's
armies in war, the one they say no living
man can kill.

GANDALF
The Witchking of Angmar.
You've met him before.
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

GANDALF
He is the Lord of the Nazgul - the greatest
of the Nine.
And Minas Morgul is his lair.

STOP

GOLLUM

The Dead City, very nasty place, full of enemies.

GOLLUM
Quick, quick! They will see, they will see.

GOLLUM
Come away, come away. Look! We have found it.
The way into Mordor!

GOLLUM
The secret stairs - climb!

SAM
No, Mr Frodo!

GOLLUM
Not that way!

GOLLUM
What's it doing?

SAM
No!

FRODO
They're calling me!

STOP

GOLLUM
Hide! Hide!

FRODO
I can feel his blade!

GOLLUM
Come, hobbits. We climb - we must climb!

STOP

GANDALF
We come to it at last, the great battle of our time.
The board is set, the pieces are moving.

GANDALF
This war is long planned. Sauron has hated
the west through many ages. It is a
hatred that flows from the depths of time,
across the deeps of the Sea.

STOP

GANDALF
Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to
be done. Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth!

GANDALF
You must not fail me.

STOP

GOTHMOG
Quiet!

FARAMIR
To the river - quick!

GOTHMOG
Faster!

ORC COMMANDER
Draw swords!

STOP

GANDALF
Amon Din, come on-

SOLDIER
The beacon! The beacon at Amon Din is lit!

GANDALF
Hope is kindled.

STOP

ARAGORN
The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons
are lit! Gondor calls for aid!

THEODEN
Then Rohan will answer. Muster the Rohirrim!

STOP

THEODEN
Assemble the army at Dunharrow - as many
men as can be found. You have two days.
On the third, we ride for Gondor, and war!

THEODEN
Gamling, make haste across the Riddermark
Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow!

STOP

ARAGORN
You ride with us?

EOWYN
Just to the encampment. It's tradition for
the women of the Court to farewell the men.

EOWYN
The Men have found their Captain - they
will follow you into battle, even to death.

STOP

THEODEN
So it is before the walls of Minas
Tirith that the doom of our time will be
decided.

EOMER
Now is the hour! Riders of Rohan - oaths
you have taken. Now, fulfil them all - to
Lord and land!

STOP

MADRIL
We can't hold them. The city is lost!

FARAMIR
Tell the men to break up. We ride for Minas
Tirith.

RANGER
Nazgul!

FARAMIR
Take cover!

FARAMIR
Pull back! Pull back to Minas Tirith!

GOTHMOG
The age of men is over. The time of the Orcs has come.

STOP

IORLAS
Open the Gates! Pull!

FARAMIR
Mithrandir!

FARAMIR
They broke through our defences. They have
taken the bridge a nd the West Bank.
Battalions of Orcs are crossing the River.

IORLAS
It is as the Lord Denethor predicted - long
has he foreseen this doom!

GANDALF
Foreseen and done nothing!

GANDALF
Faramir? This is not the first halfling
to have crossed your path.

FARAMIR
No.

PIPPIN
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

GANDALF
Where? When?

FARAMIR
In Ithilien, not two days ago. Gandalf,
they are taking the road to the Morgul
Vale.

GANDALF
- and then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.

PIPPIN
What does that mean? What's wrong?

GANDALF
Faramir, tell me everything.

STOP

GOLLUM
Careful, Master - careful! Very far to
fall. Very dangerous on the stairs.

GOLLUM
Come, Master.
Come to Smeagol.

SAM
Mr Frodo!
Get back, you. Don't touch him!

GOLLUM
Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has
Smeagol ever done to him? Master?

STOP

GOLLUM
Master carries heavy burden. Smeagol
knows. Heavy, heavy burden. Fat one
cannot know. Smeagol look after Master.

GOLLUM
He wants it - he needs it. Smeagol sees it
in his eye. Very soon he will ask you for
it - you will see. The Fat One will take
it from you.

STOP

WITCH KING
Send forth all legions. Do not stop the
attack until the city is taken. Slay them
all.

GOTHMOG
What of the Wizard?

WITCH KING
I shall break him.

STOP

SOLDIER 1
Where are Theoden's riders?

SOLDIER 2
Will Rohan's army come?

GANDALF
Courage is the best defence that you have
now.

STOP

PIPPIN
Here do I swear fealty and service to
Gondor, in peace or war, in living or
dying, from this hour henceforth, until my
lord release me, or death take me.

DENETHOR
And I shall not forget it, nor fail to
reward that which is given:
Fealty with love.
Valour with honour.
Disloyalty with vengeance.

DENETHOR
I do not think we should so lightly abandon
the outer defences; defences that your
brother long held intact.

FARAMIR
What would you have me do?

DENETHOR
I will not yield the River and Pelennor
unfought. Osgiliath must be retaken.

FARAMIR
My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

DENETHOR
Much must be risked in war. Is there a
Captain here who still has the courage to
do his Lord's will?

FARAMIR
You wish now that our places had been
exchanged, that I had died and Boromir had
lived?

DENETHOR
Yes, I wish that.

FARAMIR
Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do
what I can in his stead.

FARAMIR
If I should return, think better of me, father.

DENETHOR
That will depend on the manner of your
return.

STOP

SAM
What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?

SMEAGOL
Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so
polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that
nobody else could find and they say
"Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh
yes, my Precious, very nice.

SAM
Alright, alright - you just startled me is all.
What were you doing?

SMEAGOL
Sneaking!

SAM
Fine, have it your own way.

STOP

SAM
Sorry to wake you, Mr Frodo. We have to be
moving on.

FRODO
It's dark still.

SAM
It's always dark here-
It's gone! The Elven bread!

FRODO
What? That's all we have left!

SAM
He took it! He must have!

GOLLUM
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread!

SAM
You're a lying wretch!
What did you do with it?

FRODO
He doesn't eat it. He can't have taken it.

GOLLUM
What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses!
He took it! He took it! I seen him, he's
always stuffing himself when Master's not
looking!

SAM
That's a filthy lie!

SAM
You stinking two-faced sneak! Call me a
thief!

FRODO
Sam! Stop it!

SAM
I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

FRODO
No, Sam!

SAM
Alight, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to
go so far, I was so angry. Here, let's
rest up a bit.

FRODO
I'm alright.

SAM
No, no, you're not alright! You're
exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this
place; it's that thing around your neck.
I could help a bit. I could carry it for
a while - share the load.

FRODO
Get away!

SAM
I don't want to keep it. I just want to help!

GOLLUM
See! See! He wants it for himself.

SAM
Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of here.

FRODO
No, Sam, it's you.

FRODO
I'm sorry, Sam.

SAM
But he's a liar! He's poisoned you against me.

FRODO
You can't help me anymore.

SAM
You don't mean that.

FRODO
Go home.

STOP

GANDALF
Faramir! Your father's will has turned to
madness! Do not throw away your life so
rashly!

FARAMIR
Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

GANDALF
Your father loves you, Faramir!
And will remember it before the end.

STOP

DENETHOR
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

PIPPIN
Well yes, at least, well enough for my
own people. But we have no songs for
great halls and evil times. We seldom
sing of anything more terrible than wind or
rain.

DENETHOR
And why should your songs be unfit for my
halls, or for hours such as these. Come -
sing me a song!

PIPPIN
Home is behind, the world ahead,
And there are many paths to tread.
Through shadow to the edge of night
Until the stars are all alight.
Mist and shadow, cloud and shade:
All shall fade, all shall fade.

STOP

THEODEN
Grimbold, how many?

GRIMBOLD
I bring five hundred men from the Westfold,
my Lord.

ROHAN MARSHALL
We have three hundred more from Fenmarch,
Theoden, King.

DENETHOR
Where are the riders from Snowbourne?

GAMLING
None have come, My Lord.

THEODEN
Six thousand spears. Less than half of what I had hoped for.

ARAGORN
Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.

THEODEN
More will come.

ARAGORN
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat. We
have till dawn. Then we must ride.

STOP

LEGOLAS
The horses are restless. And the men are quiet.

EOMER
They grow nervous in the shadow of the
mountain.

GIMLI
That road there - where does that lead?

LEGOLAS
It is the road to the Dimholt. The door
under the mountain.

EOMER
None who venture there ever return.
That mountain is evil.

GIMLI
Aragorn!
Let's find some food.

STOP

EOWYN
There! A true Esquire of Rohan.

MERRY
Sorry! It isn't all that dangerous.
It isn't even sharp.

EOWYN
Well, that's no good. You won't kill many
Orcs with a blunt blade. Come on.

EOWYN
To the Smith. Go!

EOMER
You should not encourage him.

EOWYN
And you should not doubt him.

EOMER
I do not doubt his heart... Only the reach
of his arm.

EOWYN
Why should Merry be left behind? He has as
much cause to go to war as you.
Why can he not fight for those he loves?

STOP

GANDALF
Look to the Black Ships...

ARWEN
I choose a mortal life. I wish I could
have seen him, one last time.

GUARD
King Theoden awaits you, my Lord.

STOP

THEODEN
I take my leave.

ARAGORN
My Lord, Elrond.

ELROND
I come on behalf of one whom I love.
Arwen is dying.

ARAGORN
She stayed?

ELROND
She will not long survive the evil that now
spreads from Mordor.

ELROND
The light of the Evenstar is failing. As
Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the
end has come.

ARAGORN
It will not be our end, but his.

ELROND
You ride to war, but not to victory.
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -
this you know - but in secret he sends
another force which will attack from the
river.

ELROND
A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the
South. They will be in the city in two days.
You're out-numbered, Aragorn. You need more
men.

ARAGORN
There are none.

ELROND
There are those who dwell in the mountain.

ARAGORN
Murderers, traitors - you would call upon
them to fight? They believe in nothing.
They answer to no-one.

ELROND
They will answer to the King of Gondor.
Anduril, flame of the West. Forged from
the shards of Narsil.

ARAGORN
Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of
Elendil. The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

ELROND
The man who can wield the power of this
sword can summon to him an army more deadly
than any that walks this earth.

ELROND
Put aside the Ranger - become who you were
born to be - take the Dimholt Road.

ELROND
Onen i-estel Edain. U-chebin estel anim.
(I gave Hope to the Dúnedain. I keep none for myself.)

STOP

EOWYN
Why are you doing this?

EOWYN
The war lies to the East. You cannot leave
on the eve of battle. You cannot abandon the men.

ARAGORN
Eowyn-

EOWYN
We need you here-

ARAGORN
Why have you come?

EOWYN
Do you not know?

ARAGORN
It is but a shadow and a thought that you
love. I cannot give you what you seek.

STOP

GIMLI
And just where do you think you're off to?

ARAGORN
Not this time. This time you must stay, my friend.

LEGOLAS
Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness
of Dwarves?

GIMLI
You might as well accept it - we're going
with you, laddie.

STOP

GAMLING
Lord Aragorn!

ROHAN SOLDIER
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

GAMLING
He leaves because there is no hope.

THEODEN
He leaves because he must.

GAMLING
Too few have come. We cannot defeat the
armies of Mordor.

THEODEN
No, we cannot. But we will meet
them in battle, nonetheless.

STOP

THEODEN
I have left instruction: the people are to
follow your rule in my stead. Take up my
seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you
defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.

EOWYN
What other duty would you have me do, my
Lord?

THEODEN
Duty? No, I would have you smile again -
not grieve for those whose time has come.

THEODEN
You shall live to see these days renewed.

THEODEN
No more despair.

STOP

GIMLI
What kind of an army would linger in such a
place?

LEGOLAS
One that is cursed... Long ago the Men of
the Mountain swore an oath to the last King
of Gondor - to come to his aid, to fight,
but when the time came, when Gondor's need
was dire, they fled... Vanishing into the
darkness of the mountain... And so Isildur
cursed them - never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

SILENCE surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. Only the
OMINOUSLY MUFFLED THUD of their horses hooves on the dank FIR-
NEEDLES. '

WALL of ROCK towers...

GIMLI

The very warmth of my blood seems stolen
away.

Within the walls, a creepy DARK DOOR gapes like a mouth of
night. SIGNS and FIGURES are carved above its WIDE ARCH.

LEGOLAS

The way is shut. It was made by those who
are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is
shut.

AT THAT MOMENT: A CHILL WIND seems to rush out of the DOORWAY
... ARAGORN stares into the BLACKNESS, his HAIR BLOWING
WILDLY. The HORSES REAR and'BUCK'in terror, turning and
GALLOPING AWAY.

ARAGORN
Brego!

The three HORSES DISAPPEAR... ARAGORN turns resolutely
towards the DOORWAY...

ARAGORN

I do not fear death...

LEGOLAS quickly follows... swallowed by the DARKNESS.

FEAR.

GIMLI
Well, this is a thing unheard of... An Elf
will go underground when a Dwarf dare not.

Oh! I'd never hear the end of it!

GIMLI plunges into the TUNNEL behind the OTHERS!

MUCH ACTIVITY... HORNS SOUND... the ENTIRE CAMP is on the
MOVE... fires are DOUSED, TENTS pulled down, HORSES saddled.

THEODEN
We must ride light and swift. It's a long
road ahead... and man and beast must reach
the end with the strength to fight.

SUPPLIES. He is wearing an OVERSIZED HELMET and ROHIRRIM
CLOTHING... he looks at once NERVOUS and EXCITED.

KING THEODEN breaks away from a COLUMN and rides up to MERRY.

THEODEN

Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master
Meriadoc!

MERRY
All my friends have gone to battle. I would
be ashamed to be left behind!

THEODEN
It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith.
None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.

MERRY
But... I want to fight!

THEODEN
I will say no more.

KING THEODEN wheels his HORSE away...

MERRY is bitterly DISAPPOINTED. He stands, head down - a TINY
DEJECTED FIGURE - as the MIGHTY ROHIRRIM on their LARGE
HORSES ride by... a jangling sea of HELMETS, SHIELDS and
BANNERS.

SUDDENLY... MERRY is plucked off the ground! A SOLDIER has
snatched him by the collar... and plonked him down on their
SADDLE!

Beneath a HELMET and MAIL HOOD is...

... EOWYN, disguised as a MAN!

EOWYN

Ride with me.

MERRY
My Lady!

EXCITED!

EOMER

Move out - move out!

through the SILENCE.

A GHOSTLY FIGURE step from the ROCK WALLS!

MUMMIFIED SPECTRE looms before them: EYELESS SOCKETS...
ROTTEN TEETH... a pale SICKLY GLOW... the KING OF THE DEAD!

FOG SWIRLS around as the GHOST SNARLS at ARAGORN...

KING OF THE DEAD
Who enters my domain?

ARAGORN moves forward... unflinching...

ARAGORN
One who will have your allegiance.

KING OF THE DEAD

KING OF THE DEAD

None but the King of Gondor may command me!

QUICK BEAT: ARAGORN RAISES ANDURIL...

With a TERRIFYING SHRIEK, THE KING of the DEAD SWEEPS his
SWORD towards ARAGORN' S HEAD!

SLOW MOTION: ARAGORN raises 'his SWORD in ANSWER... a LOW
WHISTLE as it SWEEPS through the AIR...

CLANG! The BLADE · OF ANDURIL clashes with the SPECTRAL SWORD

ARAGORN holds the SHARP BLADE against the GHOST'S THROAT!

ARAGORN
It has been remade!

ARAGORN releases the KING OF THE DEAD... he ADDRESSES the
GHOST ARMY.

ARAGORN
Fight for us and regain your honour!

GHOSTLY FACES stare hollow-eyed at ARAGORN...

ARAGORN

What say you?

SILENCE.

ARAGORN

GIMLI
Aghh! Your wasting your time, Aragprn. They

DENETHOR bends to the STRETCHER bearing his SON.

DENETHOR

IORLAS
They were outnumbered, none survived.

GOTHMOG turns to his LIEUTENANTS...

GOTHMOG
Fear! The city is rank with it. Let us ease

LIEUTENANT
Catapults!

At his ORDERS, the GREAT CATAPULTS fire THWAT! THWAT! THWAT!

The ORC CATAPULTS do not fire rocks...

HORROR sweeps through the streets of MINAS TIRITH as the
SEVERED HEADS of FARAMIR'S HORSEMEN land amongst the
SOLDIERS!

DENETHOR looks down at FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY...

DENETHOR
My son is dead. My line is ended.

PIPPIN has run to FARAMIR and bends towards him...

He's alive!

DENETHOR
The House of Stewards has failed!...

75,000 ORCS are spread out across the PELENNOR FIELDS like a
sea of black ANTS.

Thousands of flickering TORCHES give the army the look of a

GANDALF
Send these foul beasts into the abyss!

GOTHMOG
Stay where you are!

GANDALF walks the BATTLEMENTS as the huge BOULDERS rain onto
the ORC ARMY below...

GOTHMOG glances up at a WHISTLING SOUND - a huge BOULDER
hurtles towards him. He side-steps CALMLY out of the way...

The NAZGUL circle LOW over the CITY, like VULTURES seeking

GANDALF
Not at the towers! Aim for the trolls! Kill

TOO LATE! The TOWERS reach the walls, their DOORS crashing
down, releasing ORCS directly onto the LOWER LEVELS.

As the ORC swarm from the TOWER, GANDALF realises PIPPIN has
come down from the CITADEL...

GANDALF
Peregrin Took! Go back to the citadel!

PIPPIN
They called us out to fight...

GANDALF
This is no place for a Hobbit!

GANDALF welds his STAFF, cutting through the attacking ORC
with EASE... BEHIND him, an ORC prepares to cut down GANDALF

GANDALF

The LANTERN LIG HT throws great SHADOWS upon the SHROUDED
WALLS of a wide VAULTED CHAMBER. ROW upon ROW of MARBLE TOMBS

FORM, carved in STONE, hands folded.

DENETHOR speaks in a HUSHED VOICE...

DENETHOR

No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long
slow sleep of death embalmed... we shall
burn - like the heathen kings of old!

The SERVANTS place FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY on a STONE
TABLE in the centre of the CHAMBER. They stand, heads bowed
... as MOURNERS beside a bed of death.

DENETHOR turns to his SERVANTS.

DENETHOR

BUNDLES of OIL-SOAKED wood are STACKED all around them.

SERVANTS are holding FLAMING TORCHES, awaiting their orders

The SERVANTS approach the PYRE, TORCHES held firmly.

AT THAT MOMENT: GANDALF and PIPPIN burst into the HALLOWS,

GANDALF

Stay this madness!

The fearful SERVANTS back away from the PYRE...

PYRE!

With a desperate strength, PIPPIN pushes FARAMIR off the
BURNING PYRE... they tumble down the BUNDLES of WOOD, onto
the FLOOR! PIPPIN douses FLAMES on FARAMIR'S clothing.

DENETHOR SCREAMS with RAGE!

DENETHOR
No! Do not take my son from me!

DENETHOR leaps ACROSS THE PYRE, RIPPING and TUGGING at
PIPPIN! FIRE quickly spreads up DENETHOR'S OIL-SOAKED BACK as
he hauls PIPPIN off FARAMIR!

PIPPIN

MERRY stares unseeing at PIPPIN... HORROR and SHOCK erasing

Are you going to leave me?

PIPPIN
No Merry, I'm going to look after you.

CAMERA reaches the TOWER, dissolving through the wall into...

... a small cold ROOM. FRODO BAGGINS is UNCONSCIOUS on the
floor. His eyes suddenly flicker and he WAKES UP.

TILT UP... to reveal the ORC and URUK-HAI, GORBAG and
SHAGRAT, arguing over FRODO'S BELONGINGS and CLOTHES! GORBAG
is snatching for the MITHRIL VEST.

SHAGRAT
Hey! Hands off - that shiny shirt, that's
mine.

GORBAG
It's going to the Great Eye, along with
everything else...

ANGLE ON... FRODO as he realizes that he has been STRIPPED
down to his UNDERWEAR. He clutches at his throat.

... The RING HAS GONE!

SHAGRAT
I don't take orders from stinking Morgul
rats!

GORBAG grabs for the MITHRIL VEST...

GORBAG

You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in
your guts!

BACKWARDS with his foot! GORBAG FALLS THROUGH a TRAP DOOR
leading to the floor below!

creating SUDDEN ALARM amongst the ORCS and URUK-HAI stationed
there.

SHAGRAT leans through the TRAP DOOR...

SHAGRAT

The scum tried to knife me! Kill him!
1

SEVERAL URUK-HAI converge on GORBAG - he LASHES OUT, slashing
one across the throat with his SWORD!

The DEAD URUK-HAI topples backwards over the PARAPET...

... landing on top of URUK-HAI and ORCS in the courtyard
below. Within moments, a brutal CIVIL WAR breaks out between
the TWO COMPANIES stationed in CIRITH UNGOL!

SAM is confronted with the sight of over 50 SLAUGHTERED ORC
and URUK-HAI, strewn over the COURTYARD!

SEVERAL URUK-HAI are running DOWN TOWARDS HIM! He grips STING
and continues CHARGING UP - SCREAMING at the top of his
lungs!

on the wall in front of them! They turn around and flee in
terror back to the top of the stairs!

SAM appears - and before the URUK-HAI can fully regain their
wits - he slays THREE... YELLING:

SAM
That's for Frodo!
And for the Shire!
And that's for my old Gaffer!

SAM runs into the TOWER...

climbs back into the room... with VENGEANCE in his EVIL
EYES.

GORBAG
Stop your squeaking you dunghill rat!

exposing his neck. He pulls out his SWORD, ready to cut
FRODO'S throat...

GORBAG
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig!

SUDDENLY! GORBAG GASPS as STING is rammed into his back by
SAM!

SAM
Not if I stick you first!

GORBAG falls dead!

FRODO

Sam!!!

FRODO
Oh, Sam... I'm so sorry... sorry for
everything.

SAM quickly cuts FRODO free.

SAM
Come on.

FRODO

It's too late. It's over... they've taken
it. Sam - they took the Ring!!

SAM

Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

SAM pulls the RING from his pocket...

SAM
I thought I'd lost you... so I took it -
only for safe-keeping.

RN...
IG

FRODO
Give it to me.

FRODO
Give me the Ring, Sam.

SAM seems strangely reluctant... ON THE SOUNDTRACK to HUM of
the RING builds

FRODO
Sam! Give me the Ring.

FRODO
You must understand... The Ring is my
burden... it will destroy you, Sam.

FRODO looks at SAM, pain in his eyes...

SAM looks down at FRODO... his plain HOBBIT face full of
compassion. SAM'S resolve hardens, a new strength takes hold.

SAM
Come on, Mr Frodo, we'd best find you some
clothes... you can't go walking through
Mordor in naught but your skin.

FRODO and SAM are now dressed in FOUL-LOOKING ORC gear...

CIRITH UNGOL... into MORDOR.

GORGOROTH PLATEAU - the mountain is erupting streams of ASH
and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of
MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH.

With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep
path into the dark kingdom...

... TWO TINY FIGURES in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before
them lies the PLAIN of GORGOROTH... Their eyes are drawn to
the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE of MOUNT DOOM...

SAM
We did it, Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor.

FRODO
There are so many of them. So many.
We'll never get through unseen.

FRODO
It's him - the Eye.

The GREAT EYE OF SAURON!

SAM cannot see what FRODO sees. GENTLY, he urges FRODO on.

SAM
We have to go in there, Mr Frodo. There's
nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

alone... he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice.

GANDALF
Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The
darkness is deepening.

He turns and crosses the HALL to reveal the presence of
GIMLI, LEGOLAS, EOMER and ARAGORN...

ARAGORN, his back to GANDALF...

ARAGORN
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

GANDALF
It's only a matter of time. He has suffered
a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of
Mordor our enemy is regrouping.

GIMLI sits insolently on the SEAT of the STEWARD...

GIMLI
Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should
we care?

GANDALF looks across at the DWARF... His face ashen.

GANDALF
Because ten thousand Orcs now stand between
Frodo and Mount Doom.

GANDALF

I have sent him to his death.

ARAGORN
No.

GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN...

ARAGORN
There is still hope for Frodo. He needs
time and safe passage across the Plains of
Gorgoroth. We can give him that.

GANDALF
How?

ARAGORN
Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands.
Then we gather our full strength and march
on the Black Gate.

EOMER
We cannot achieve victory from strength of
arms.

ARAGORN
Not for ourselves. But we can give Frodo
his chance if we keep Sauron's eye fixed
upon us. Keep him blind to all else that
moves.

LEGOLAS
A diversion...

GANDALF
Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not
take the bait!

GIMLI
Certainty of death. Small chance of
success. What are we waiting for?

STOP

SAM
Look, the Orcs! They're moving off. You
see, Mr Frodo - some luck at last.

STOP

SAM
Take mine. There's a few drops left.

FRODO
There'll be none left for the return
journey.

SAM
I don't think there will be a return
journey, Mr Frodo.

STOP

ARAGORN
Let the lord of the Black Land come forth;
let justice be done upon him.

MOUTH OF SAURON
My master Sauron the Great bids thee welcome.

MOUTH OF SAURON
Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me?

GANDALF
We do not come to treat with Sauron, faithless and accursed.
Tell your master this. The armies of Mordor must disband.
He is to depart these lands, never to return.

MOUTH OF SAURON
Aha! Old Greybeard!
I have a token I was bidden to show thee.

PIPPIN & MERRY
Frodo, no!

GANDALF
Silence!

MOUTH OF SAURON
The Halfling was dear to thee I see.
Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.
Who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain?
And he did Gandalf, he did.

MOUTH OF SAURON
And who is this? Isildur's heir?
It takes more to make a King than a broken Elvish blade.

GIMLI
I guess that concludes negotiations.

ARAGORN
I do not believe it. I will not!

STOP

ARAGORN
Pull back! Pull back!

STOP

SAM
It's gone, Mr Frodo.

SAM
The light's passed on, away towards the
North! Something's drawn it's gaze.

STOP

ARAGORN
Hold your ground - hold your ground!
Sons of Gondor - of Rohan. My brothers!

ARAGORN
I see in your eyes the same fear that would
take the heart of me. The day may come when
the courage of Men fails; when we forsake
our friends and break all bonds of
fellowship; but it is not this day!
An hour of wolves and shattered shields, when
the Age of Man comes crashing down - but it
is not this day! This day we fight! By
all that you hold dear on this good earth -
I bid you stand!
Men of the West!

STOP

GIMLI
Never thought I'd die fighting side by side
with an Elf.

LEGOLAS
What about side by side with a friend?

GIMLI
Aye, I could do that.

STOP

SAM
Do you remember the Shire, Mr Frodo?
It'll be spring soon, and the orchards
will be in blossom; and the birds will be
nesting in the hazel thicket; and they'11
be sowing the summer barley in the lower
fields; and eating the first of the
strawberries with cream.
Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

FRODO
No, Sam. I can't recall the taste of food;
nor the sound of water; nor the touch of
grass. I'm naked in the dark.
There's no veil between me and the wheel of
fire. I can see it with my waking eyes.

SAM
Then let us be rid of it - once and for
all! Come on, Mr Frodo. I can't carry it
for you - but I can carry you! Come on!

STOP

ARAGORN
For Frodo.

STOP

SAM
Look, Mr Frodo! We're almost there!

GOLLUM
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

STOP

PIPPIN
Eagles-

PIPPIN
The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming!

STOP

SAM
Frodo!

FRODO
I'm here, Sam.

SAM
Destroy it - go on! Throw it in the fire!

SAM
What are you waiting for? Just let it go!

FRODO
The Ring is mine.

SAM
No! :

STOP

GOLLUM
Yes! YES!
Precious! Precious!

STOP

SAM
Give me your hand.
Take my hand!

SAM
No! Don't you let go! Don't let go. Reach!

STOP

FRODO
It's gone. It's done.

SAM
Yes, Mr Frodo. It's over now.

FRODO
I can see the Shire. The Brandywine
River, Bag End, Gandalf's fireworks, the
lights in the Party Tree.

SAM
Rosie Cotton dancing. She had ribbons in
her hair. If ever I was to marry someone, it
would have been her. It would have been
her.

FRODO
I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee.
here at the end of all things.

STOP

GANDALF
Now come the days of the King.
May they be blessed.

ARAGORN
This day does not belong to one man but to
all. Let us together rebuild this world
that we may share in the days of peace.

STOP

ARAGORN
My friends. You bow to no-one.

STOP

FRODO
And thus it was a Fourth Age of Middle-
earth began, and the Fellowship of the
Ring, though eternally bound by friendship
and love, was ended.
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey,
we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight:
We were home!

FRODO
How do you pick up the threads of an old
life? How do you go on, when in your heart
you begin to understand. There is no going
back. There are some things that time
cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep.
That have taken hold.

SAM
Mr Frodo?

SAM
What is it?

FRODO
It's been four years to the day since
Weathertop, Sam. It's never really healed.

SAM
"There and Back Again. A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.
And The Lord of the Rings, by Frodo Baggins".
You've finished it!

FRODO
Not quite. There's room for a little more.

FRODO
Bilbo once told me, the great stories never
end - that each of us must come and go in
the telling. His part in this tale was now
over. There would be no more journeys for
Bilbo. Save one.

STOP

BILBO
Tell me again, lad. Where are we going?

FRODO
To the harbour, Bilbo. The Elves have
accorded you a special honour. A place on
the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

BILBO
Frodo, any chance of seeing that old
ring of mine? The one I gave you?

FRODO
Sorry, Uncle. I'm afraid, I lost it.

BILBO
Oh, pity. I should like to have held it
one last time.

BILBO
Oh! Well, here's a sight I have never·seen
before.

STOP

GALADRIEL
The power of the Three Rings is ended. The
time has come for the Dominion of Men.

ELROND
I Aear can ven na mar.
(The Sea calls us home.)

BILBO
I think I'm quite ready for another
adventure.

GANDALF
Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now
finished. Here at last, on the shores of
the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship.

GANDALF
I will not say: "do not weep", for not all
tears are an evil.

GANDALF
It is time, Frodo.

SAM
What does he mean?

FRODO
We set out to save the Shire, and it has
been saved. But not for me.

SAM
You don't mean that - you can't leave.

FRODO
The last pages are for you, Sam.

STOP

SAM
Elanor!

FRODO
My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in
two. You have to be one and whole for many
years. You have so much enjoy and to be and
to do. Because Sam, your part in the
journey goes on.

SAM
Hello, little Frodo!

SAM
Well, I'm back.
