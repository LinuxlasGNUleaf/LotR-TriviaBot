MAN AT BAR
I'm dying of thirst over here! Come on! Come on!

BARTENDER
Here you are.

BARMAID
Watch it!

BAR PATRON
Sorry, darling.

BARMAID
Here you are.

THORIN
Ah, thank you.

GANDALF
Mind if I join you?

GANDALF
I'll have the same.

GANDALF
I should introduce myself. My name is Gandalf. Gandalf the Grey.

THORIN
I know who you are.

GANDALF
Well, now, this is a fine chance. What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?

THORIN
I received word that my Father had been seen wandering the wilds near Dunland. I went looking, found no sign of him.

GANDALF
Thorin, it's been a long time since anything but rumor was heard of Thrain.

THORIN
He still lives, I am sure of it.

THORIN
My father came to see you before he went missing. What did you say to him?

GANDALF
I urged him to march upon Erebor, to rally the seven armies of the dwarves.
To destroy the dragon and take back the Lonely Mountain,
and I would say the same to you. Take back your homeland.

THORIN
This is no chance meeting is it, Gandalf?

GANDALF
No, it is not. The Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin. That dragon has sat there long enough,
sooner or later darker minds will turn towards Erebor.
I ran into some unsavory characters whilst traveling along the Greenway. They mistook me for a vagabond.

THORIN
I imagine they regretted that.

GANDALF
One of them was carrying a message.

GANDALF
It is Black Speech.

GANDALF
A promise of payment.

THORIN
For what?

GANDALF
Your head. Someone wants you dead. Thorin, you can wait no longer. You are the heir to the throne of Durin.
Unite the armies of the dwarves, together you have the might and power to retake Erebor.
Summon a meeting of the seven dwarf families, demand they stand by their oath.

THORIN
The seven armies swore that oath to the one who wields the King's jewel, the Arkenstone.
It is the only thing that will unite them, and in case you have forgotten, that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

GANDALF
What if I were to help you reclaim it?

THORIN
How? The Arkenstone lies half a world away, buried beneath the feet of a fire breathing dragon.

GANDALF
Yes, it does. Which is why we're going to need a burglar.

STOP

THORIN
How close is the pack?

BILBO
Too close, couple of leagues, no more. But that's not the worst of it.

DWALIN
Have the Orcs picked up our scent?

BILBO
Not yet, but they will do. We have another problem.

GANDALF
Did they see you? They saw you.

BILBO
No, that's not it.

GANDALF
Good, what did I tell you? Quite as a mouse. Excellent burglar material.

BILBO
Will you listen! I'm trying to tell you there is something else out there.

GANDALF
What form did it take? Like a bear?

BILBO
Yes, but bigger. Much bigger.

BOFUR
You knew about this beast?

BOFUR
I say we double back.

THORIN
We'll be run down by a pack of Orcs.

GANDALF
There is a house, it's not far from here, where we might take refuge.

THORIN
Whose house? Are they friend or foe?

GANDALF
Neither. He will help us or he will kill us.

THORIN
What choice do we have?

GANDALF
None.

STOP

GANDALF
This way! Quickly!

GANDALF
Into the house! Run!

GANDALF
Come on! Get inside!

GANDALF
Open the door!

THORIN
Quickly!

DWALIN
Come on, lads!

ORI
What is that?

GANDALF
That is our host.
His name is Beorn, he's a skin-changer. Sometimes he's a huge black bear, sometimes he's a great strong man.
The bear is unpredictable, but the man can be reasoned with. However, he is not over fond of dwarves.

ORI
He's leaving.

DORI
Come away from there! It's not natural, none of it. It's obvious, he's under some dark spell.

GANDALF
Don't be a fool. He's under no enchantment but his own.

GANDALF
Alright now, get some sleep all of you. You'll be safe here tonight.

GANDALF
I hope.

STOP

NARZUG
Attack them now. Kill the Dwarf filth while they sleep.

AZOG
No. The Beast stands guard.

AZOG
We will kill them on the road.

BOLG
They are gathering in Dol Guldur. The Master has summoned you.

STOP

THE NECROMANCER
We grow in number. We grow in strength. You will lead my armies.

AZOG
What of Oakenshield?

THE NECROMANCER
War is coming.

AZOG
You promised me his head.

THE NECROMANCER
Death will come to all.

STOP

NARZUG
Do we call off the hunt?

AZOG
Bolg! I have a task for you. Do you still thirst for Dwarf blood?

STOP

BEORN
So you are the one they call Oakenshield. Tell me, why is Azog the Defiler hunting you?

THORIN
You know of Azog? How?

BEORN
My people were the first to live in the mountains, before the Orcs came down from the north.
The Defiler killed most of my family, but some he enslaved. Not for work, you understand, but for sport.
Caging skin-changers and torturing them seemed to amuse him.

BILBO
There are others like you?

BEORN
Once there were many.

BILBO
And now?

BEORN
Now there's only one. You need to reach the mountain before the last days of autumn.

GANDALF
Before Durin's Day falls, yes.

BEORN
You are running out of time.

GANDALF
Which is why we must go through Mirkwood.

BEORN
A darkness lies upon that forest, fell things creep beneath those trees.
There is an alliance between the Orcs of Moria and The Necromancer in Dol Guldur.
I would not venture there, except in great need.

GANDALF
We will take the Elven Road, their path is still safe.

BEORN
Safe? The Wood Elves of Mirkwood are not like their kin. They're less wise and more dangerous. But it matters not.

THORIN
What do you mean?

BEORN
These lands are crawling with Orcs, their numbers are growing and you are on foot.
You will never reach the forest alive. I don't like dwarves, they're greedy and blind,
blind to the lives of those they deem lesser than their own.
But Orcs I hate more.

BEORN
What do you need?

BEORN
Go now, while you have the light. Your hunters are not far behind.

STOP

GANDALF
The Elven Gate.

GANDALF
Here lies our path through Mirkwood.

DWALIN
No sign of the Orcs. We have luck on our side.

GANDALF
Set the ponies loose. Let them return to their master.

BILBO
This forest feels sick, as if a disease lies upon it. Is there no way around?

GANDALF
Not unless we go two hundred miles north, or twice that distance south.

GALADRIEL
Something moves in the shadows, unseen, hidden from our sight. Every day it grows in strength. Beware of The Necromancer, he is not what he seems.

GALADRIEL
If our enemy has returned, we must know. Go to the tombs in the mountains.

GANDALF
The High Fells. So be it.

GANDALF
Not my horse, I need it!

BILBO
You're not leaving us?

GANDALF
I would not do this unless I had to.

GANDALF
You've changed, Bilbo Baggins. You're not the same hobbit as the one who left the Shire.

BILBO
I was going to tell you.

BILBO
I found something in the Goblin tunnels.

GANDALF
Found what?

GANDALF
What did you find?

BILBO
My courage.

GANDALF
Good. Well, that's good. You'll need it.

GANDALF
I'll be waiting for you at the overlook, before the slopes of Erebor.

GANDALF
Keep the map and key safe. Do not enter that mountain without me.

GANDALF
This is not the Greenwood of old, the very air of the forest is heavy with illusion that will seek to enter your mind and lead you astray.

BILBO
Lead us astray? What does that mean?

GANDALF
You must stay on the path, do not leave it. If you do, you'll never find it again.

GANDALF
No matter what may come, stay on the path!

THORIN
Come on, we must reach the mountain before the sun sets on Durin's Day. Let's go, we've but one chance to find the hidden door.

STOP

THORIN
The path turns this way.

DWALIN
This way.

BOFUR
Air, I need air.

OIN
My head, it's spinning! What's happening?

THORIN
Keep moving.

THORIN
Nori, why have you stopped?

NORI
The path, it's disappeared!

ORI
What's going on?

BOFUR
We've lost the path!

THORIN
Find it. All of you, look.

DWALIN
Look for the path!

BALIN
I don't remember this place, none of it's familiar.

DORI
It's got to be here.

THORIN
What hour is it?

DWALIN
I don't know, I don't even know what day it is.

THORIN
Is there no end to this accursed forest!

DORI
Look, a tobacco pouch. There's Dwarves in these woods.

BOFUR
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains, no less. This is exactly the same as mine.

BILBO
Because it is yours, do you understand? We're going around in circles, we are lost!

THORIN
We are not lost. We keep heading east.

DWALIN
But which way is the east? We've lost the sun!

BILBO
The sun. We have to find the sun.
Up there. We need to-

THORIN
Enough! Quiet! All of you! We are being watched.

BILBO
I can see a lake! And a river. And the Lonely Mountain!

BILBO
We're almost there!

BILBO
Can you hear me? I know which way to go!
Hello? Look, come on!

STOP

SPIDER #1
Kill them. Kill them! Eat them now while all their blood is running.

SPIDER #2
Their hide is tough. This could be juicy inside.

SPIDER #1
Stick it again. Stick it again. Finish it off.

SPIDER #2
The meat's alive and kicking.

SPIDER #1
Kill them, kill them now. Let us feast, feast, feast. Feast, feast!

SPIDER #2
Kill them now!

SPIDER #1
Feast! Feast!

SPIDER #1
What is it? What is it? What is it?

SPIDER #2
Fat and juicy! Just a little taste.

SPIDER #2
Curse it! Where is it? Where is it?

BILBO
Here!

SPIDER #2
It stings! It stings!

BILBO
Sting. That's a good name. Sting.

BOFUR
Where's Bilbo?

BILBO
I'm up here!

BILBO
Where is it? Where is it? Come on! Where is it?

BILBO
No! No! No!

THORIN
Dwalin! Kill it! Kill it!

DWALIN
Come on, keep up!

THORIN
Clear!

STOP

LEGOLAS
Do not think I won't kill you, Dwarf. It would be my pleasure.

KILI
Throw me a dagger! Quick!

TAURIEL
If you think I'm giving you a weapon, Dwarf, you are mistaken!

STOP

LEGOLAS
Search them!

GLOIN
Hey, give it back! That's private!

LEGOLAS
Who is this? Your brother?

GLOIN
That is my wife!

LEGOLAS
And what is this horrid creature? A Goblin Mutant?

GLOIN
That's my wee lad, Gimli!

LEGOLAS
Are the spiders dead?

TAURIEL
Yes, but more will come. They're growing bolder.

LEGOLAS
This is an ancient Elvish blade. Forged by my kin.

LEGOLAS
Where did you get this?

THORIN
It was given to me.

LEGOLAS
Not just a thief, but a liar as well.

STOP

BOFUR
Thorin, where's Bilbo?

LEGOLAS
Close the gates.

STOP

DWALIN
This is not the end of it! Do you hear me?

BIFUR
Let us out of here!

KILI
Aren't you going to search me? I could have anything down my trousers?

TAURIEL
Or nothing.

LEGOLAS
Why does that Dwarf stare at you, Tauriel?

TAURIEL
Who can say? He's quite tall for a Dwarf. Do you not think?

LEGOLAS
Taller than some.

LEGOLAS
but no less ugly.

GLOIN
Arhhg, again!

BALIN
Leave it! There is no way out! This is no Orc dungeon. These are the Halls of the Woodland realm.
No one leaves here, but, by the King's consent.

STOP

THRANDUIL
Some may imagine that a Noble quest is at hand. A Quest to reclaim a homeland and slay a dragon.
I myself, suspect a more prosaic motive. Attempted burglary, or something of that ilk.

THRANDUIL
You have found a way in. You seek that which would bestow upon you the right to rule.
A King's jewel. The Arkenstone. It is precious to you beyond measure, I understand that.
There are gems in the mountain that I too desire. White gems of pure starlight. I offer you my help.

THORIN
I am listening.

THRANDUIL
I will let you go, if you but return what is mine.

THORIN
A favor for a favor.

THRANDUIL
You have my word. One King to another.

THORIN
I would not trust, Thranduil, the great King, to only his word. Till the end of all days be upon us!
You lack all honor! I have seen how you treat your friends! We came to you once, starving, homeless;
seeking your help. But you turned your back!
You, turned away from the suffering of my people and the inferno that destroyed us!

THORIN
May you die in dragon fire!

THRANDUIL
Do not talk to me of dragon fire! I know its wrath and ruin. I have faced the great serpents of the North.

THRANDUIL
I warned your grandfather of what his greed would summon, but he would not listen.

THRANDUIL
You are just like him.

THRANDUIL
Stay here if you will, and rot. A hundred years is a mere blink in a life of an Elf. I'm patient. I can wait.

STOP

BALIN
Did he offer you a deal?

THORIN
He did. I told him he could go ishkh khakfe andu null. Him and all his kin!

BALIN
Well, that's that then. The deal was our only hope.

THORIN
It's not our only hope.

STOP

THRANDUIL
I know you're there.

THRANDUIL
Why do you linger in the shadows?

TAURIEL
I was coming to report to you.

THRANDUIL
I thought I ordered that nest to be destroyed not two moons past.

TAURIEL
We cleared the forest as ordered, my Lord. But more spiders keep coming up from the south.
They are spawning in the ruins of Dol Guldur, if we could kill them at their source-

THRANDUIL
That fortress lies beyond our borders. Keep our lands clear of those foul creatures, that is your task.

TAURIEL
And when we drive them off, what then? Will they not spread to other lands?

THRANDUIL
Other lands are not my concern. The fortunes of the world will rise and fall, but here in this kingdom, we will endure.
Legolas said you fought well today. He's grown very fond of you.

TAURIEL
I assure, my Lord, Legolas thinks of me as not more than a Captain of the Guard.

THRANDUIL
Perhaps he did once. Now I'm not so sure.

TAURIEL
I do not think that you would allow your son to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.

THRANDUIL
No, you are right, l would not. Still, he cares about you. Do not give him hope where there is none.

STOP

NARZUG
The gates are guarded.

BOLG
Not all of them. Follow me.

STOP

TAURIEL
The stone in your hand, what is it?

KILI
It is a Talisman.

KILI
A powerful spell lies upon it, if any but a dwarf reads the runes on this stone they will be forever cursed!

KILI
Or not. Depending on whether you believe in that kind of thing. It's just a token.
A Rune Stone. My mother gave me it to me so I'd remember my promise.

TAURIEL
What promise?

KILI
That I would come back to her. She worries. She thinks I'm reckless.

TAURIEL
Are you?

KILI
Nah.

KILI
Sounds like quite a party you're having up there.

TAURIEL
It is Mereth Nuin Giliath; The Feast of Starlight. All light is sacred to the Eldar, but the Wood Elves love best the light of the stars.

KILI
I always thought it is a cold light, remote and far away.

TAURIEL
It is memory, precious and pure.

TAURIEL
Like your promise.

TAURIEL
I have walked there sometimes, beyond the forest and up into the night.
I have seen the world fall away and the white light forever fill the air.

KILI
I saw a fire moon once. It rose over the pass near Dunland.
Huge! Red and gold it was, it filled the sky. We were an escort for some merchants from Ered Luin,
they were trading in silverwork for furs. We took the Greenway south, keeping the mountain to our left,
and then it appeared. This huge fire moon lighting our path. I wish I could show you-

STOP

LETHUIN
Galion, you old rogue! We're running out of drink.

ELROS
These empty barrels should have been sent to Esgaroth hours ago. The party have been waiting for them.

LETHUIN
Say what you like about our ill tempered King he has excellent taste in wine. Come, Elros, try it.

ELROS
I have the dwarves in my charge.

LETHUIN
They're locked up, where can they go?

STOP

BOFUR
I'll wager the sun in on the rise. Must be nearly dawn.

ORI
We're never gonna reach the mountain, are we?

BILBO
Not stuck in here you're not.

BALIN
Bilbo!

BILBO
Ssh! There are guards, nearby!
Not that way. Down here, follow me!

BOMBUR
Which way?

BILBO
Come on! This way. Come on!

KILI
I don't believe it, we're in the cellars!

BOFUR
You're supposed to be leading us out not further in!

BILBO
I know what I'm doing!
Okay, this way. This way.

BILBO
Everyone, climb into the barrels, quickly!

DWALIN
Are you mad? They'll find us!

BILBO
No, no. They won't! I promise you. Please, please, you must trust me!

THORIN
Do as he says!

BOFUR
What do we do now?

BILBO
Hold your breath.

BOFUR
Hold my breath? What do you mean?

STOP

TAURIEL
Where is the keeper of the keys?

STOP

THORIN
Well done, Master Baggins.

THORIN
Go, come on let's go!

BALIN
Hold on!

LEGOLAS
Shut the gate!

THORIN
No!

BOFUR
Watch out!

BOLG
Slay them all!

THORIN
Get over the bridge!

BOLG
Kill her! Kill the She-Elf!
After them!

LEGOLAS
Tauriel, wait! This one we keep alive.

BOLG
After them! Cut them off!

STOP

GANDALF
Oh, it's you.

RADAGAST
Why am I here, Gandalf?

GANDALF
Trust me, Radagast, I would not have called you here without good reason.

RADAGAST
This is not a nice place to meet.

GANDALF
No, it is not.

RADAGAST
These are dark spells, Gandalf. Old and full of hate. Who's buried here?

GANDALF
If he had a name, it's long since been lost. He would've been known only as a servant of evil. One of a number. One of nine.

RADAGAST
Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.

GANDALF
The Ringwraiths have been summoned to Dol Guldur.

RADAGAST
But it cannot be the Necromancer. A human sorcerer could not summon such evil.

GANDALF
Who said it was human? The nine only answer to one master. We've been blind, Radagast. And in our blindness, the enemy has returned. He is summoning his servants. Azog the Defiler is no ordinary hunter. He is a commander, a commander of legions. The enemy is preparing for war. It will begin in the east. His mind is set upon that mountain.

RADAGAST
Where are you going?

GANDALF
To rejoin the others.

RADAGAST
Gandalf!

GANDALF
I started this, I cannot forsake them. They are in grave danger.

RADAGAST
If what you say is true, the world is in grave danger. The power in that fortress will only grow stronger.

GANDALF
You want me to cast my friends aside.

STOP

THORIN
Anything behind us?

BALIN
Not that I can see.

BOFUR
I think we've outrun the Orcs.

THORIN
Not for long, we've lost the current.

DWALIN
We almost half drowned!

THORIN
Make for the shore!

DWALIN
Aye.

THORIN
Come on, let's go!

KILI
I'm fine, it's nothing.

THORIN
On your feet.

FILI
Kili's wounded, his leg needs binding.

THORIN
There's an Orc pack at our tail. We keep moving.

BALIN
To where?

BILBO
To the mountain, we're so close.

BALIN
A lake lies between us and that mountain, we have no way to cross it.

BILBO
So then we go around.

DWALIN
The Orcs will run us down as sure as daylight. We've no weapons to defend ourselves.

THORIN
Bind his leg, quickly. You have two minutes.

STOP

BARD
Do it again and you're dead.

BALIN
Excuse me, but you're from Lake-town, if I'm not mistaken? That barge over there, it wouldn't be available for hire by any chance?

BARD
What makes you think I would help you?

BALIN
Those boots have seen better days, as has that coat.

BALIN
No doubt you have some hungry mouths to feed? How many bairns?

BARD
A boy and two girls.

BALIN
And your wife, I imagine, she's a beauty?

BARD
Aye, she was.

BALIN
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-

DWALIN
Oh, come on, come on. Enough with the niceties.

BARD
What's your hurry?

DWALIN
What's it to you?

BARD
I would like to know who you are, and what you were doing in these lands.

BALIN
We are simple merchants from the Blue Mountains, journeying to see our kin in the Iron Hills.

BARD
Simple merchants, you say?

THORIN
We need food, supplies, weapons. Can you help us?

BARD
I know where these barrels came from.

THORIN
What of it?

BARD
I don't know what business you had with the elves, but I don't think it ended well.
No one enters Lake-town but by lead of the master. All his wealth comes from trade with the Woodland realm.
He would see you in irons before risking the wrath of king Thranduil.

BALIN
I'll wager there are ways to enter that town unseen.

BARD
Aye. But for that you would need a smuggler.

BALIN
For which we would pay double.

STOP

THRANDUIL
Such is the nature of evil. Out there in the vast ignorance of the world it festers and spreads.
A shadow that grows in the dark. A sleepless malice as black as the oncoming wall of night.
So it ever was. So will it always be. In time all foul things come forth.

LEGOLAS
You were tracking a company of thirteen dwarves. Why?

NARZUG
Not thirteen, not anymore. The young one, the blackhead archer, we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.
The poison's in his blood, he'll be choking on it soon.

TAURIEL
Answer the question, filth.

NARZUG
I do not answer to dogs, She-Elf!

LEGOLAS
I would not antagonize her.

TAURIEL
You like killing things, Orc? You like death? Then let me give it to you!

THRANDUIL
Enough! Tauriel, leave! Go now.

THRANDUIL
I do not care about one dead dwarf. Answer the question, you have nothing to fear.
Tell us what you know and I will set you free.

LEGOLAS
You had orders to kill them, why? What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

NARZUG
The Dwarf runt will never be King!

LEGOLAS
King? There is no King under the mountain, nor will there ever be.
None would dare to enter Erebor Whilst the dragon lives.

NARZUG
You know nothing. You're world will burn.

LEGOLAS
What are you talking about? Speak!

NARZUG
Your time has come again. My master serves the one.
Do you understand now, Elfling? Death is upon you. The flames of war are upon you.

LEGOLAS
Why did you do that? You promised to set him free.

THRANDUIL
And I did. I freed his wretched head from his miserable shoulders.

LEGOLAS
There was more the Orc could tell us.

THRANDUIL
There was nothing more he could tell me.

LEGOLAS
What did he mean by the flames of war?

THRANDUIL
It means they intend to unleash a weapon so great it will destroy all before it.

THRANDUIL
I want the watch doubled at our borders, all roads, all rivers. Nothing moves but I hear of No one enters this kingdom and no one leaves it.

LEGOLAS
Close the gate! Keep it sealed by order of the King.

ELROS
What about Tauriel?

LEGOLAS
What about her?

ELROS
She went into the forest armed with her bow and blade. She has not returned.

STOP

HUNTER ORC
Dwarf blood! They were here!

BOLG
There is another scent.

BOLG
Man flesh!

BOLG
They have found a way to cross the lake.

STOP

BOFUR
Watch out!

THORIN
What are you trying to do? Drown us?

BARD
I was born and bred on these waters, Master Dwarf. If I wanted to drown you, I would not do it here.

DWALIN
Oh, I've had enough of this lippy lake-man. I say we throw him over the side and be done with him.

BILBO
Oh, Bard. He's name's Bard.

DWALIN
How do you know?

BILBO
I asked him.

DWALIN
I don't care what he calls himself, I don't like him.

BALIN
We do not have to like him, we simply have to pay him.

BALIN
Come on, now, lads. Turn out your pockets.

DWALIN
How do we know he won't betray us?

THORIN
We don't.

BALIN
There's just a wee problem. We're ten coins short.

THORIN
Gloin, come on. Give us what you have.

GLOIN
Don't look to me. I have been bled dry by this venture! What have I seen for my investment? Naught but misery and grief and-

GLOIN
Bless my beard.
Take it. Take all of it.

BARD
The money, quick. Give it to me.

THORIN
We will pay you when we get our provisions, but not before.

BARD
If you value your freedom, you'll do as I say. There are guards ahead.

DWALIN
Ssh. What's he doing?

BILBO
He's talking to someone. He's pointing right at us. Now they're shaking hands.

THORIN
What?

DWALIN
He's selling us out.

STOP

BARD
Quiet! We're approaching the toll gate.

PERCY
Halt! Goods inspection. Papers please!

PERCY
Oh, it's you, Bard!

BARD
Morning, Percy.

PERCY
Anything to declare?

BARD
Nothing. But I am cold and tired, and ready for home.

PERCY
You and me both.

PERCY
There we are, all in order.

ALFRID
Not so fast.

ALFRID
Consignment of empty barrels from the Woodland realm.

ALFRID
Only they're not empty. Are they Bard? If I recall correctly, you're licensed as a bargeman. Not a fisherman.

BARD
That's none of your business.

ALFRID
Wrong. It's the Master's business, which makes it my business.

BARD
Oh, come on, Alfrid. Have a heart, people need to eat.

ALFRID
These fish are illegal.

ALFRID
Empty the barrels over the side.

BRAGA
You heard him, in the canal.

BRAGA
Come on. Get a move on.

BARD
Folk in this town are struggling. Times are hard. Food is scarce.

ALFRID
That's not my problem.

BARD
And when the people hear the Master is dumping fish back in the lake? When the rioting starts? Will it be your problem then?

ALFRID
Stop! Ever the people's champion, hey, Bard? Protector of the common folk.
You might have their favor now, bargeman, but it won't last.

PERCY
Raise the gate!

ALFRID
The Master has his eye on you. You'll do well to remember, we know where you live.

BARD
It's a small town, Alfrid. Everyone knows where everyone lives.

STOP

ALFRID
All this talk of civil unrest, someone's been stirring the pot, Sire. Gout playing out, Sire?

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
It's the damp! It's the only possible explanation. Now, get me a brandy.

ALFRID
The mood of the people, Sire, it's turning ugly.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
They're commoners, Alfrid. They've always been ugly.
It's not my fault they live in a place that stinks of fish-oil and tar.
Jobs, shelter, food. It's all they ever bleat about.

ALFRID
It's my belief, Sire. They're being led on by troublemakers.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Then we must find these troublemakers and arrest them.

ALFRID
My thoughts exactly, Sire.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
And all this talk of a change must be suppressed. We can't afford to let the rabble band together,
start making noises. The next you know, they'll start asking questions, forming committees.
Launching inquiries.

ALFRID
Out with the old, in with the new.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
What?

ALFRID
That's what they've been saying, Sire. There is even talk of an election.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
An election? That's absurd! I won't stand for it.

ALFRID
I don't think they'd ask you to stand, Sire.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Shirkers, ingrates, rabble rousers!
Who would have the nerve to question my authority? Who would dare? Who-?

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Bard. You mark my words, that trouble making bargeman is behind all this.

STOP

DWALIN
Get your hands off me.

BARD
You didn't see them, they were never here. The fish you can have for nothing.

BARD
Follow me.

BAIN
Da, our house! It's being watched.

BARD
You can tell the Master I'm done for the day.

TILDA
Da! Where have you been?

SIGRID
Father, there you are. I was worried.

BARD
Here, Sigrid.

BARD
Bain, get them in.

DWALIN
If you speak of this to anyone, I'll rip your arms off.

DWALIN
Get off.

BAIN
Up there.

SIGRID
Da, why are there dwarves coming out of our toilet?

TILDA
Will they bring us luck?

BARD
They may not be the best fit, but they'll keep you warm.

BILBO
Oh, thank you.

STOP

THORIN
The Dwarvish Wind-Lance!

BILBO
You look like you've seen a ghost.

BALIN
He has. The last time we saw such a weapon the city was on fire. It was a day the dragon came. The day that Smaug destroyed Dale.

BALIN
Girion, the lord of the city, rallied his bowmen to fire upon the beast. But a dragon's hide is tough, tougher than the strongest armor. Only a Black Arrow fired from a wind-lance could have pierced the dragon's hide. And few of those arrows were ever made.

BALIN
The store was running low when Girion made his last stand.

THORIN
If the aim of men had been true that day, much would've been different.

BARD
You speak as if you were there.

THORIN
All Dwarves know the tale.

BAIN
Then you would know that Girion hit the dragon. He loosened his scale under the left wing, one more shot and he would've killed the beast.

DWALIN
That's a fairy story, lad. Nothing more.

THORIN
You took our money. Where are the weapons?

BARD
Wait here.

STOP

THORIN
Tomorrow begins the last days of Autumn.

BALIN
Durin's Day falls the morning after next. We must reach the mountain before then.

KILI
And if we do not? If we fail to find the hidden door before that time?

FILI
Then this quest has been for nothing.

THORIN
What is this?

BARD
Pike hook. Made from an old harpoon.

KILI
And this?

BARD
A crow bill, we call it. Fashioned from a smithy's hammer. It's heavy in a hand, I grant.
But in defense of your life, these will serve you better than none.

GLOIN
We paid for weapons. Iron forged, swords and axes!

BOFUR
It's a joke!

BARD
You won't find better outside the city armory. All iron forged weapons are held there under lock and key.

BALIN
Thorin, why not take what's on offer and go. I've made do with less, so have you. I say we leave now.

BARD
You're not going anywhere.

DWALIN
What did you say?

BARD
There are spies watching this house and probably every dock and wharf in the town. We must wait till nightfall.
Thorin.

BAIN
Da?

BARD
Don't let them leave.

STOP

TAURIEL
I thought you were an Orc.

LEGOLAS
If I were an Orc you would be dead.

LEGOLAS
Tauriel, you cannot hunt thirty Orcs on your own.

TAURIEL
But I'm not on my own.

LEGOLAS
You knew I would come.

LEGOLAS
The King is angry, Tauriel. For six hundred years my father has protected you, favored you. You defied his orders, you betrayed his trust.

LEGOLAS
Come back with me, he will forgive you.

TAURIEL
But I will not. If I go back, I will not forgive myself.

TAURIEL
The King has never let Orc filth roam our lands. Yet he would let this Orc pack cross our borders and kill our prisoners.

LEGOLAS
It is not our fight.

TAURIEL
It is our fight. It will not end here. With every victory this evil will grow. If your father has his way, we will do nothing. We will hide within our walls, live our lives away from the light and let darkness descend. Are we are not part of this world? Tell me, mellon, when did we let evil become stronger than us?

STOP

STALLKEEPER
Hello, Bard. What are you after?

BARD
There was a tapestry. An old one. Where's it gone?

STALLKEEPER
What tapestry are you talking about?

BARD
This one.

LAKE-TOWN FEMALE #1
They were dwarves I tell you. Appeared out of nowhere. Full beards, fierce eyes. I've never seen the like.

LAKE-TOWN MALE #1
What are dwarves doing in these parts?

LAKE-TOWN MALE #2
It's the prophecy.

LAKE-TOWN MALE #1
Prophecy?

LAKE-TOWN MALE #2
Prophecy of Durin's folk.

BARD
A prophecy?

LAKE-TOWN MALE #3
The old tales have come true.

LAKE-TOWN FEMALE #2
Vast halls of treasure!

LAKE-TOWN FEMALE #3
Can it really be true? Has the Lord of Silver Fountains returned?

BARD
The Lord of Silver Fountains. The King of Carven Stone. The King Beneath the Mountain, shall come into his own.
And the bells shall ring in gladness at the Mountain King's return.
But all shall fade in sadness. And the lake will shine and burn.

STOP

BAIN
Da! I tried to stop them.

BARD
How long have they been gone?

STOP

DWALIN
Shh. Keep it down.

THORIN
As soon as we have the weapons, we'll make straight for the mountain.

THORIN
Go, go, go.
You alright?

KILI
I can manage. Let's just get out of here.

STOP

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
What is the meaning of this?

BRAGA
We caught 'em stealing weapons, Sire.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Ah! Enemies of the state, huh?

ALFRID
A desperate bunch of mercenaries, if ever there was, Sire.

DWALIN
Hold your tongue!

DWALIN
You do not know to whom you speak. This is no common criminal. This is Thorin. Son of Thrain, son of Thror!

THORIN
We are the dwarves of Erebor. We have come to reclaim our homeland.

THORIN
I remember this town in the great days of old. Fleets of boats lay at harbor, filled with silks and fine gems. This was no forsaken town on a lake. This was the center of all trade in the north!

THORIN
I would see those days return. I would relight the great forges of the dwarves and send wealth and riches flowing once more from the halls of Erebor!

BARD
Death! That is what you'll bring upon us.

BARD
Dragonfire and ruin. If you awaken that beast, it will destroy us all.

THORIN
You can listen to this naysayer, but I promise you this; if we succeed all will share in the wealth of the mountain.

THORIN
You will have enough gold to rebuild Esgaroth ten times over!

BARD
All of you! Listen to me, you must listen! Have you forgotten what happened to Dale?
Have you forgotten those who died in the firestorm? And for what purpose?
The blind ambition of a Mountain King, so riven by greed, he could not see beyond his own desire!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Now. Now. We must not, any of us, be too quick to lay blame. Let us not forget,
that it was Girion, Lord of Dale, your ancestor, who failed to kill the beast. Hm!

ALFRID
It's true, Sire. We all know the story. Arrow after arrow, he shot. Each one missing its mark.

BARD
You have no right. No right to enter that mountain.

THORIN
I have the only right.

THORIN
I speak to the Master of the men of the lake. Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?
Will you share in the great wealth of our people?

THORIN
What say you?

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
I say unto you: Welcome!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Welcome and rise! Welcome, King Under the Mountain!

STOP

BILBO
You do know we're one short? Where's Bofur?

THORIN
If he's not here, we leave him behind.

BALIN
We'll have to, if we're to find the door before nightfall. We can risk no more delays.

THORIN
Not you. We must travel at speed, you will slow us down.

KILI
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.

THORIN
No, no.

KILI
I'm going to be there when that door's opened. When we first look upon the halls of our fathers, Thorin-

THORIN
Kili, stay here. Rest. Join us when you're healed.

OIN
I'll stay with the lad. My duty lies with the wounded.

FILI
Uncle, we grew up on tales of the mountain. Tales you told us.
You cannot take that away from him! I will carry him if I must!

THORIN
One day you will be King and you will understand.
I cannot risk the fate of this quest for the sake of one dwarf. Not even my own kin.

THORIN
Fili, don't be a fool. You belong with the company.

FILI
I belong with my brother.

STOP

BOFUR
By my beard, is that the time!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Go now with our good will.

BOFUR
Wait!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
And may your return bring fortune to all!

BOFUR
No! Did you miss the boat as well?

FILI
Kili? Kili!

STOP

BARD
No. I'm done with dwarves, go away!

BOFUR
No! No! No one will help us. Kili's sick. He's very sick.

STOP

BILBO
What is this place?

BALIN
It was once the city of Dale. Now it is a ruin. The Desolation of Smaug.

THORIN
The sun will soon reach midday. We must find the hidden door into the mountain before it sets. This way.

BILBO
Wait. Is this the overlook? Gandalf said to meet him here, on no account were we to-

THORIN
Do you see him? We have no time to wait upon the wizard. We're on our own. Come.

STOP

GANDALF
Dol Guldur. The hill of sorcery.

RADAGAST
It looks completely abandoned.

GANDALF
As it is meant to. A spell of concealment lies over this place. Which means our enemy is not yet ready to reveal himself. He has not regained his full strength. Radagast, I need you to carry a message to the Lady Galadriel. Tell her, we must force his hand.

RADAGAST
What do you mean?

GANDALF
I'm going in alone. On no account come after me.

GANDALF
Do I have your word?

RADAGAST
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

RADAGAST
Wait, Gandalf! What if it's a trap?

GANDALF
Turn around and do not come back.

GANDALF
It's undoubtedly a trap.

GANDALF
The evil that is hidden here, I command it to come forth! I command it to reveal itself!

AZOG
The Wizard has come.

ORC
He is lifting the spell. He will find us!

AZOG
Yes, he will!

STOP

THORIN
Anything?

DWALIN
Nothing!

THORIN
If the map is true, the hidden door lies directly above us. Up here!

THORIN
You have keen eyes, Master Baggins.

THORIN
This must be it. The hidden door.
Let all those who doubted us, rue this day!

DWALIN
Hey, we have a key.

DWALIN
Which means there's somewhere there is a keyhole.

THORIN
The last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.
We're losing the light. Come on!

NORI
Be quiet. I can't hear when you're thumping!

DWALIN
I can't find it. It's not here! It's not here!

THORIN
Break it down!

THORIN
Come on!

THORIN
We lost the light.

BALIN
It's no good! The door's sealed! Can't be open by force. Powerful magic on it.

THORIN
No! The last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.

THORIN
That's what it says. What did we miss?

THORIN
What did we miss? Balin.

BALIN
We've lost the light. There's no more to be done. We had but one chance. Come away, lads. It's over.

BILBO
Wait a minute, what? Where are they going?

BILBO
You can't give up now!
Thorin. You can't give up now.

BILBO
Stand by the grey stone. When the thrush knocks, and the setting sun.
And the last light of Durin's Day will shine.

BILBO
The last light. The last light!

BILBO
The keyhole! Come back! Come back!
It's the light of the moon! The last moon of Autumn!

BILBO
Where's the key? Where's the key? Where's the-?
It was here. Come on. It was here It was just-

STOP

THORIN
Erebor. I know these walls. These halls. This stone.
You remember it, Balin. Chambers filled with golden light.

BALIN
I remember.

GLOIN
Herein lies the seventh kingdom of Durin's folk.
May the heart of the mountain unite all dwarves in defense of this home.

BALIN
The throne of the king.

BILBO
And what's that above it?

BALIN
The Arkenstone.

BILBO
The Arkenstone. And what's that?

THORIN
That, Master Burglar, is why you are here.

stopped

BOFUR
Can you not do something?

OIN
I need herbs, something to bring down his fever.

BARD
We have nightshade, feverfew-

OIN
They're no use to me. Do you have any Kingsfoil?

BARD
No, it's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.

BOFUR
Pigs?

BOFUR
Weed? Right.

BOFUR
Don't move.

STOP

BILBO
You want me to find a jewel?

BALIN
A large white jewel, yes.

BILBO
That-that's it? Only I imagine there's quite a few down there.

BALIN
There is only one Arkenstone. And you'll know it when you see it.

BILBO
Right.

BALIN
In truth, lad. I do not know what you will find down there. You needn't go if you don't want to. There's no dishonor in turning back.

BILBO
No. Balin, I promised I would do this. And I think I must try.

BALIN
It never ceases to amaze me.

BILBO
What's that?

BALIN
The courage of hobbits. Go now, with as much luck as you can muster.

BALIN
Oh, and, Bilbo.

BILBO
Mm?

BALIN
If there is in fact a- a live dragon down there: Don't waken it.

STOP

AZOG
You have come too late, Wizard! It is done.

GANDALF
Where is your master? Where is he?

AZOG
He is everywhere. We are legion!

AZOG
It is over.

AZOG
Run him down!

THE NECROMANCER
There is no light, Wizard, that can defeat darkness.

GANDALF
Sauron.

STOP

BILBO
Hello? He's not at home. Not at home. Good. Good, good, good.

BILBO
Arkenstone. Arkenstone. A large, white jewel. Very helpful.

SMAUG
Well, thief-

SMAUG
I smell you. I hear your breath. I feel your air. Where are you? Where are you?
Come, now. Don't be shy. Step into the light.

SMAUG
Mm. There is something about you. Something you carry. Something made of gold. But far more - precious.

SMAUG
There you are, thief in the shadows.

BILBO
I did not come to steal from you, oh Smaug, the unaccessibly wealthy.
I merely wanted to gaze upon your magnificence.
To see if you really were as great as the old tales say. I did not believe them.

SMAUG
And do you now?

BILBO
Truly. The tales and songs fall utterly short of your enormity, oh Smaug, the stupendous.

SMAUG
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

BILBO
No. No.

SMAUG
No indeed. You seem familiar with my name. But I don't remember smelling your kind before.
Who are you and where do you come from, may I ask?

BILBO
I come from under the hill.

SMAUG
Underhill?

BILBO
And under hills and over hills my path has led. And and through the air, I am he who walks unseen.

SMAUG
Impressive, what else do you claim to be?

BILBO
I am luck wearer, r-riddle maker.

SMAUG
Lovely titles. Go on.

BILBO
Barrel rider.

SMAUG
Barrels? Now that is interesting. And what about your little dwarf friends? Where are they hiding?

BILBO
Dwarves? No. No, no. No dwarves here. You've got that all wrong.

SMAUG
Oh, I don't think so, barrel rider. They sent you in here to do their dirty work while they skulk about outside.

BILBO
Truly, you are mistaken, oh Smaug, chiefest and greatest of calamities.

SMAUG
You have nice manners for a thief and a liar. I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.
No one better. It is the gold, they are drawn to treasure like flies to dead flesh.

SMAUG
Did you think I did not know this day would come? That a pack of canting dwarves would come crawling back to the mountain.

STOP

ORI
Was that an earthquake?

BALIN
That, my lad, was a dragon.

STOP

SIGRID
Da?

BAIN
It's coming from the mountain.

FILI
You should leave us. Take your children and get out of here.

BARD
And go where? There is nowhere to go.

TILDA
Are we going to die, Da?

BARD
No, darling.

TILDA
The dragon, it's going to kill us.

BARD
Not if I kill it first.

Stop

SMAUG
The King Under the Mountain is dead. I took his throne, I ate his people like a wolf among sheep.

SMAUG
I kill where I wish, when I wish. My armor is iron. No blade can pierce me!

STOP

BARD
Alright.

BAIN
A Black Arrow. Why did you never tell me?

BARD
Because you did not need to know.

BARD
Listen to me carefully, I need you to distract the guards.
Once I'm at the top of the tower, I'll slip the arrow to the bow.

LAKE-TOWN GUARD
There he is! Guards, after him!

BARD
Quickly! Down there! Go!

LAKE-TOWN GUARD
Stop him!

BARD
Bain! Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find it.

BAIN
No.

BARD
I'll deal with them!

BAIN
I'm not leaving!

BARD
Go!

BARD
Braga.

BRAGA
You're under arrest.

BARD
On what charge?

BRAGA
Any charge the Master chooses.

STOP

ORI
What about Bilbo?

THORIN
Give him more time.

BALIN
Time to do what? To be killed?

THORIN
You're afraid.

BALIN
Yes, I'm afraid. I fear for you. A sickness lies upon that treasure horde.
A sickness which drove your grandfather mad.

THORIN
I am not my grandfather.

BALIN
You're not yourself. The Thorin I know would not hesitate to go in there.

THORIN
I will not risk this quest for the life of one burglar.

BALIN
Bilbo. His name is Bilbo.

STOP

SMAUG
It's Oakenshield. That filthy dwarvish usurper. He sent you in here for the Arkenstone, didn't he?

BILBO
No! No, no, no. I don't know what you're talking about.

SMAUG
Don't bother denying it. I guessed his foul purpose some time ago. But it matters not. Oakenshield's quest will fail. A darkness is coming. It will spread to every corner of the land.

SMAUG
You are being used, thief in the shadows. You were only ever a means to an end. The coward Oakenshield has weighed the value of your life and found it worth nothing.

BILBO
No. No, you're lying.

SMAUG
What did he promise you? A share of the treasure? As if it was his to give. I will not part with a single coin. Not one piece of it!

SMAUG
My teeth are swords, my claws are spears. My wings are a hurricane!

BILBO
So it is true. The Black Arrow found its mark.

SMAUG
What did you say?

BILBO
I was just saying, your reputation precedes you, oh Smaug, the tyrannical. Truly, you have no equal on this earth.

SMAUG
I am almost tempted to let you take it, if only to see Oakenshield suffer.
Watch it destroy him, watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad.
But I think not, I think our little game ends here. So tell me, thief. How do you choose to die?

STOP

SIGRID
Da? Is that you, Da?

ORC
Oakenshield has gone!

BOLG
Fall back! Regroup at the bridge!

BAIN
You killed them all.

LEGOLAS
There are others. Tauriel, come.

OIN
We're losing him!

BOFUR
What are you doing?

TAURIEL
I'm going to save him.

STOP

THORIN
You're alive.

BILBO
Not for much longer.

THORIN
Did you find the Arkenstone?

BILBO
The dragon's coming!

THORIN
The Arkenstone? Did you find it?

BILBO
No, we have to get out.

SMAUG
You will burn!

THORIN
Come on!

BALIN
Come on, Bilbo!

THORIN
Come on.

STOP

TAURIEL
Hold him down.

SIGRID
Tilda!

STOP

THORIN
Ssh. Ssh-ssh.

DORI
We've given him the slip.

DWALIN
No, he's too cunning for that.

BILBO
So where to now?

THORIN
The western guard room. There may be a way out.

BALIN
It's too high. There's no chance that way.

THORIN
It's our only chance. We'll have to try.

THORIN
Come on.

STOP

OIN
I've heard tale of the wonders of elvish medicine. That was a privilege to witness.

KILI
Tauriel.

TAURIEL
Lie still.

KILI
You cannot be her. She is far away. She is far, far away from me.
She walks in starlight in another world. It was just a dream.

KILI
Do you think she could've loved me?

STOP

THORIN
Stay close.

DWALIN
That's it then. There's no way out.

BALIN
The last of our kin. They must've come here, hoping beyond hope.

BALIN
We could try to reach the mines. We might last a few days.

THORIN
No. I will not die like this. Cowering, clawing for breath.

THORIN
We make for the forges.

DWALIN
He'll see us, sure as death.

THORIN
Not if we split up.

BALIN
Thorin, we'll never make it.

THORIN
Some of us might. Lead him to the forges. We kill the dragon. If this is to end in fire, then we will all burn together.

THORIN
This way!

SMAUG
Flee! Flee! Run for your lives! There is nowhere to hide.

ORI
Behind you!

DORI
Come on!

DORI
Run!

DWALIN
Hey, you! Here!

STOP

BOLG
Send word to Dol Guldur, Oakenshield has reached the Mountain!

BOLG
Go. You! Come with me.

STOP

BALIN
This way! It's this way! Come on!

THORIN
Follow Balin!

BALIN
Come on!

DWALIN
Thorin! Hold on! The plan's not gonna work.
These furnaces are stone cold.

BALIN
He's right. We've no fire hot enough to set them ablaze.

THORIN
Have we not?

STOP

THORIN
I did not look to see you so easily outwitted!
You have grown slow and fat in your dotage. Slug!

THORIN
Take cover. Go!

THORIN
Bombur! Get those billows working! Go!
Bilbo! Up there. On my mark, pull that lever.

THORIN
Balin, can you still mix a flash flame?

BALIN
Aye, it will only take a jiffy!

BALIN
Come on!

DWALIN
We don't have a jiffy.

DORI
Where's the sulfur? Are you sure you know what you're doing? Come on!

THORIN
Now!

THORIN
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings.

THORIN
Keep going, Bilbo! Run!

SMAUG
You think you can deceive me, barrel rider? You have come from Lake-town.
This is some sordid scheme hatched between these filthy dwarves and those miserable trading lakemen.
Those sniveling cowards with their long bows and black arrows. Perhaps it is time I paid them a visit.

BILBO
Oh no!

BILBO
This isn't their fault! Wait! You cannot go to Lake-town!

SMAUG
You care about them, do you? Good. Then you can watch them die!

THORIN
Here! You witless worm!

SMAUG
You.

THORIN
I am taking back what you stole.

SMAUG
You will take nothing from me, Dwarf. I laid low your warriors of old.
I instill terror in the hearts of men. I am King Under the Mountain.

THORIN
This is not your kingdom. These are Dwarf lands. This is Dwarf gold. And we will have our revenge.

SMAUG
Ah, revenge! Revenge! I will show you revenge!

BARD
Listen to me! Do you not know what is coming?

SMAUG
I am fire. I am - death!

BILBO
What have we done?
