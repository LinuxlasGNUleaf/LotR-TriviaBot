MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
I warned you! Did I not warn you what would come of dealing with Dwarves? Now they've done it! They've woken the dragon; they've brought the apocalypse upon our heads! Come on, quickly, quickly! Faster now, I'm trying to evacuate myself here! Careful with that. Never mind the books! Get on, get the rest of it.

ALFRID
But, Sire, should we not try to save the town?

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
The town is lost, save the gold!

LAKE-TOWNER
Pile 'em up!

TAURIEL
We have no time, we must leave.

STOP

FILI
Get him up.

FILI
Come on, brother. Come on, come on, let's go.

KILI
I'm fine, I can walk.

TAURIEL
As fast as you can.

BAIN
We're not leaving, not without our father.

TAURIEL
If you stay here, your sisters will die. Is that what your father would want?

BARD
Open this door! Do you hear me!

BOFUR
Down here, now!

OIN
Give me your hand.

BOFUR
Come on, we gotta go!

TAURIEL
Quickly now, hurry!

FILI
Kili, come on!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Come on! Come On! Faster! Faster!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
If only we could take more of these poor people with us. But they're hardly worth it.

ALFRID
I quite agree.

BOFUR
Look out!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Move it! Move it! Come on! Faster!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
My gold! My gold!

ALFRID
We carry too much weight. We need to dump something.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Quite right, Alfrid. Faster, faster!

BALIN
Poor souls.

BAIN
Da!

TILDA
Da!

KILI
He hit it! He hit the dragon!

TAURIEL
No.

KILI
He did, he hit its mark, I saw!

TAURIEL
These arrows cannot pierce its hide. I fear nothing will.

BOFUR
What are you doing?

FILI
Come back! Bain! Come back!

BOFUR
Bain!

FILI
Come back here!

BOFUR
Bain!

TAURIEL
Leave him! We cannot go back.

TILDA
Bain!

BAIN
Dad!

BARD
Bain! What are you doing? Why didn't you leave? You were supposed to leave!

BAIN
I came to help you.

BARD
No! Nothing can stop it now.

BAIN
This might.

BARD
Bain, you go back. You get out of here now.

BAIN
Da!

BARD
Bain!

BAIN
Da!

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Stop, stop! Halt! Halt!

SMAUG
Who are you that would stand against me?

SMAUG
Now that is a pity. What will you do now, bowman? You are forsaken. No help will come.

MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Now's our chance! Go now! Head to the open water!

SMAUG
Hmm. Is that your child? You cannot save him from the fire. He will burn!

BARD
Stay still, son. Stay still.

SMAUG
Tell me, wretch, how now shall you challenge me?

SMAUG
You have nothing left but your death!

BARD
Bain. Look at me. You look at me. A little to your left.

BARD
That's it.

BARD
Bain! Hold on!

ORI
Wh…what was that? What happened?

BILBO BAGGINS
It fell, I saw it. It's dead.

BILBO BAGGINS
Smaug is dead.

GLOIN
By my beard, I think he's right!

GLOIN
Look there! The Ravens of Erebor are returning to the Mountain.

BALIN
Aye, word will spread. Before long, every soul in Middle Earth will know the Dragon is dead!

GALADRIEL
You are not alone, Mithrandir.

LAKE-TOWNER
Will somebody help me! Don't let me go.

ALFRID
Help!

SIGRID
Da!

TILDA
Da!

SIGRID
Da!

ALFRID
Ahh! Why me?

KILI
Tauriel.

FILI
Kili, come on. We're leaving.

TAURIEL
They are your people, you must go.

KILI
Come with me. I know how I feel, I'm not afraid. You make me feel alive.

TAURIEL
No, I can't.

KILI
Tauriel. Amrâlimê.

TAURIEL
I don't know what that means.

KILI
I think you do.

TAURIEL
My Lord Legolas.

LEGOLAS
Take your leave of the Dwarf. You are needed elsewhere.

KILI
Keep it, as a promise.

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
These are dry. You'll need them.

LAKE-TOWN REFUGEE
Thank you.

ALFRID
Oi! Give me one of them. I'll take my death in this cold!

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
Oh, find your own! You're not in charge now, Alfrid Lickspittle.

ALFRID
That is where you are wrong. In the absence of the Master the powers seethes to his deputy, which in this instance is my good self. Now give me that blanket!

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
Master's Deputy? Don't make me laugh. You're a sneak thief, more like. I'll be dead before I answer to the likes of you.

ALFRID
Maybe that can be arranged.

BARD
I wouldn't go turning on your own, Alfrid. Not now.

TILDA
Da!

BARD
Come here.

SIGRID
You're alive!

BARD
It's alright.

LAKE-TOWN MAN
It was Bard! He killed the dragon! I saw it with me own eyes. He brought the beast down. Struck him dead with a Black Arrow!

LAKE-TOWNER
You've saved us all, bless you.

ALFRID
All hail to the Dragon-slayer! All hail King Bard!

ALFRID
I have said it many times, this is a man of noble stock. A born leader.

BARD
Do not call me that. I'm not the Master of this town.

BARD
Where is he? Where's the master?

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
Half way down the Anduin, with all our coin, I don't doubt.

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
You would know. You helped him empty the treasury.

ALFRID
No. I tried to stop him.

LAKE-TOWNER #1
Liar!

LAKE-TOWNER #2
Thief!

LAKE-TOWNER #3
You're a mongrel!

ALFRID
I begged, I pleaded

LAKE-TOWNER #4
Do away with him!

ALFRID
I said:“Master, no!”

ALFRID
Think of the children.

ALFRID
Will nobody think of the children?

LAKE-TOWNER #1
Hang him!

LAKE-TOWNER #5
To the tree with him!

BARD
Enough, Let him go! Let him go!

BARD
Look around you! Have you not had your fill of death?

BARD
Winter is upon us. We must look to our own, to the sick and the helpless. Those who can stand, tend to the wounded, and those who have strength left, follow me. We must salvage what we can.

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
And what then? What do we do then?

BARD
We find shelter.

BOFUR
Hello! Bombur? Bifur? Anybody?

BILBO BAGGINS
Wait! Wait!

BOFUR
It's Bilbo. He's alive!

BILBO BAGGINS
Stop! Stop! Stop! You need to leave. We all need to leave.

BOFUR
We only just got here.

BILBO BAGGINS
I tried talking to him, but he won't listen.

OIN
Wh…what do you mean, laddie?

BILBO BAGGINS
Thorin! Thorin. Thorin, he's been down there for days. He doesn't sleep, he barely eats. He's not been himself, not at all. It's this…it's this place. I think a sickness lies upon it.

KILI
A sickness? What kind of sickness?

BILBO BAGGINS
Fili? Fili!

THORIN
Gold. Gold beyond measure, beyond sorrow and grieve.

THORIN
Behold, the great treasure hoard of Thrór.

THORIN
Welcome, my sister's sons, to the Kingdom of Erebor.

BOFUR
Balin!

DWALIN
Bofur!

BIFUR
Kili!

KILI
Bifur!

BOFUR
Bombur!

BOMBUR
You're alive!

THORIN
Any sign of it?

BIFUR
Nothing here.

ORI
Nothing here.

THORIN
Keep searching!

DWALIN
That jewel could be anywhere.

THORIN
The Arkenstone is in these halls. Find it!

DWALIN
You heard him, keep looking.

THORIN
All of you! No one rests until it is found!

SMAUG
I am almost tempted to let you take it, if only to see Oakenshield suffer. Watch it destroy him. Watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad.

BARD
Take only what you need, we have a long march ahead.

LEGOLAS
Where will you go?

BARD
There is only one place.

ALFRID
The Mountain? You are a genius, Sire. We can take refuge inside the Mountain. It might smell a bit of dragon, but the women could clean that up. It's be safe and warm and dry, and full of stores, bedding and clothing, the odd bit of gold.

BARD
What gold is in that Mountain is cursed. We will take only what was promised to us, only what we need to rebuild our lives.

ALFRID
Here, pull your weight.

LEGOLAS
News of the death of Smaug will have spread through the lands.

BARD
Aye.

LEGOLAS
Others will now look to the Mountain for its wealth or its position.

BARD
What is it you know?

LEGOLAS
Nothing for certain. It's what I fear may come.

BOLG
Woodland Elves! The King's son and a She-elf, they tracked us to Lake-town.

AZOG
And you killed them?

BOLG
They fled, squealing like cowards.

AZOG
You fool! They will return with an Army of Elves at their backs! Ride to Gundabad. Let the Legions come forth.

AZOG
Elves! Men! Dwarves! The Mountain will be their tomb! To war!

TAURIEL
You saw something out there?

LEGOLAS
The Orc I pursued out of Lake-town, I know who he is. Bolg, the spawn of Azog the Defiler. A Wargpack was waiting for him on the outskirts of Esgorath. They fled into the north. These Orcs were different from the others, they bore a mark I had not seen for a long time. The mark of Gundabad.

TAURIEL
Gundabad?

LEGOLAS
An Orc stronghold in the far north of the Misty Mountains.

FEREN
My Lord Legolas. I bring word from your Father. You are to return to him immediately.

LEGOLAS
Come, Tauriel.

FEREN
My Lord…Tauriel is banished.

LEGOLAS
Banished?

LEGOLAS
You may tell my father if there is no place for Tauriel, there is no place for me.

TAURIEL
Legolas, it is your King's command.

LEGOLAS
Yes, he is my King, but he does not command my heart.

LEGOLAS
I ride north. Will you come with me?

TAURIEL
To where?

LEGOLAS
To Gundabad.

KEEPER OF THE DUNGEONS
Spells will not save you, old man.

KEEPER OF THE DUNGEONS
This is my master's domain. Die now, Wizard!

NECROMANCER
Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky. Seven for the Dwarv-lords in their halls of stone.

GALADRIEL
Nine for mortal men doomed to die.

NECROMANCER
You cannot fight the shadow. Even now you fade. One light alone in the darkness.

GALADRIEL
I am not alone.

SARUMAN
Are you in need of assistance, My Lady?

ELROND
You should have stayed dead!

GALADRIEL
Mithrandir, come back.

GANDALF
He…he is here.

GALADRIEL
Yes. The darkness has returned.

RADAGAST
Gandalf! Gandalf, climb on!

GALADRIEL
He is weak. He cannot remain here, it is straining his life.

GALADRIEL
Go, quickly!

GANDALF
Come with me, My Lady.

GALADRIEL
Go!

NECROMANCER
It has begun. The East will fall. So shall the Kingdom of Angmar rise. The time of the Elves is over. The Age of the Orc has come.

GALADRIEL
You have no power here, servant of Mordor. You are nameless, faceless, formless! Go back to the void from whence you came!

ELROND
We were deceived.

GALADRIEL
The spirit of Sauron endured.

SARUMAN
And has been banished.

GALADRIEL
He will flee into the East.

ELROND
Gondor should be warned. They must set a watch on the walls of Mordor.

SARUMAN
No. Look after the Lady Galadriel. She has spent much of her powers, her strength is failing. Take her to Lothlórien.

ELROND
My Lord Saruman, he must be hunted down and destroyed, once and for all.

SARUMAN
Without the Ring of Power, Sauron can never again hold dominion over Middle Earth. Go now. Leave Sauron to me.

GANDALF
I need a horse.

RADAGAST
What? Gandalf, where are you going?

GANDALF
To warn Erebor. They have no idea what is coming. I saw them with my own eyes. Rank upon rank of Moria Orcs. You must summon our friends, bird and beast. The battle for the Mountain is about to begin.

THORIN
It is here in these halls, I know it.

DWALIN
We have searched and searched.

THORIN
Not well enough.

DWALIN
Thorin, we all would see the stone returned.

THORIN
And yet it's still not found!

BALIN
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here?

BALIN
The Arkenstone is the birthright of our people.

THORIN
It is the King's jewel. Am I not the King?!

THORIN
Know this, if anyone should find it and withhold it from me, I will be avenged.

BALIN
Dragon sickness. I've seen it before. That look, the terrible need. It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo. It sent his grandfather mad.

BILBO BAGGINS
Balin, if-if Thorin had the Arkenstone. Well, if-if it was found, would it help?

BALIN
That stone crowns all. It's the summit of this great wealth, bestowing power upon he who bears it. But stay his madness? No, lad. I fear it would make him worse. Perhaps it is best it remains lost.

THORIN
What is that?

THORIN
In your hand.

BILBO BAGGINS
It's nothing.

THORIN
Show me.

BILBO BAGGINS
It…

BILBO BAGGINS
I picked it up in Beorn's garden.

THORIN
You've carried it all this way?

BILBO BAGGINS
I'm going to plant it in my garden. In Bag End.

THORIN
It's a poor prize to take back to the Shire.

BILBO BAGGINS
One day it'll grow, and every time I look at it, I'll remember. Remember everything that happened:the good, the bad and how lucky I am that I made it home.

BILBO BAGGINS
Thorin, I…

DWALIN
Thorin, the survivors from Lake-town, they're streaming into Dale. There's hundreds of them.

THORIN
Call everyone to the gate.

THORIN
To the gate. Now!

BARD
Come on, keep moving.

ALFRID
Sire! Sire! Up here!

ALFRID
Look Sire! The braziers are lit.

BARD
So, the company of Thorin Oakenshield survived.

ALFRID
Survived? You mean there's a bunch of Dwarves in there with all that gold?

BARD
I shouldn't worry, Alfrid. There's gold enough in that Mountain for all.

BARD
Make camp here tonight. Find what shelter you can. Get some fires going.

LAKE-TOWNER
Come on, hurry along now.

BARD
Alfrid, you take the night watch.

THORIN
I want this Fortress made safe by sun-up. This Mountain was hard-won, I will not see it taken again.

KILI
The people of Lake-town have nothing. They came to us in need. They have lost everything.

THORIN
Do not tell me what they have lost. I know well enough of hardship. Those who've lived through dragon fire should rejoice! They have much to be grateful for.

THORIN
More stone! Bring more stone to the gate!

PERCY
These children are starving. We need food. We won't last three days. Bard, we don't have enough.

BARD
Do what you can, Percy.

PERCY
It will be all right, don't worry.

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
We need more water.

BARD
The children, the wounded and the women come first.

BARD
Morning, Alfrid. What news from the night watch?

ALFRID
All quiet, Sire. Not much to report. Nothing gets past me.

BARD
Except an army of Elves, it would seem.

BARD
My Lord Thranduil, we did not look to see you here.

THRANDUIL
I heard you needed aid.

BARD
You have saved us. I do not know how to thank you.

THRANDUIL
Your gratitude is misplaced. I did not come on your behalf. I came to reclaim something of mine.

THRANDUIL
There are gems in the Mountain that I too desire. White gems of pure starlight.

THORIN
The White gems of Lasgalen. I know an Elf-lord who will pay a pretty price for these.

BARD
Wait! Please, wait! You will go to war over a handful of gems?

THRANDUIL
The heirlooms of my people are not lightly forsaken.

BARD
We are allies in this. My people also have claim upon the riches in that Mountain. Let me speak with Thorin.

THRANDUIL
You would try to reason with the Dwarf.

BARD
To avoid war? Yes.

THORIN
Nice going lads, nice work. Come on!

BARD
Hail Thorin, son of Thrain. We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.

THORIN
Why do you come to gates of the King under the Mountain armed for war?

BARD
Why does the King under the Mountain fence himself in like a robber in his hole?

THORIN
Perhaps it is because I'm expecting to be robbed.

BARD
My Lord, we have not come to rob you, but to seek fair settlement. Will you not speak with me?

THORIN
I'm listening.

BARD
On behalf of the people of Lake-town, I ask that you honor your pledge. A share of the treasure, so that they might rebuild their lives.

THORIN
I will not treat with any man, while an armed host lies before my door.

BARD
That armed host will attack this mountain if we do not come to terms.

THORIN
And your threats do not sway me.

BARD
What of your conscience?

THORIN
Does it not tell you our cause is just? My people offered you help and in return you brought upon them only ruin and death.

BARD
When did the men of Lake-town come to our aid but for the promise of rich reward. A bargain was struck!

THORIN
A bargain? What choice did we have but to barter our birthright for blankets and food. To ransom our future in exchange for our freedom. You call that a fair trade? Tell me, Bard the dragon-slayer, why should I honor such terms?

BARD
Because you gave us your word. Does that mean nothing?

THORIN
Begone! Ere our arrows fly!

BILBO BAGGINS
What are you doing? You cannot go to war.

THORIN
This does not concern you.

BILBO BAGGINS
Excuse me, but just in case you haven't noticed, there is an army of Elves out there. Not to mention several hundred angry fishermen. We…we are in fact outnumbered.

THORIN
Not for much longer.

BILBO BAGGINS
What does that mean?

THORIN
It means, Master Baggins, you should never underestimate Dwarves. We have reclaimed Erebor. Now we defend it.

BARD
He will give us nothing.

THRANDUIL
Such a pity. But still you tried.

BARD
I do not understand. Why? Why would he risk war?

THRANDUIL
It is fruitless to reason with them. They understand only one thing.

THRANDUIL
We attack at dawn.

THRANDUIL
Are you with us?

THORIN
Master Baggins, come here.

THORIN
You're going to need this.

THORIN
Put it on.

THORIN
This vest is made of silver steel. Mithril it was called by my forebears. No blade can pierce it.

BILBO BAGGINS
I look absurd. I'm not a warrior, I'm a Hobbit.

THORIN
It is a gift, a token of our friendship. True friends are hard to come by.

THORIN
I have been blind, but now I'm beginning to see. I am betrayed!

BILBO BAGGINS
Betrayed?

THORIN
The Arkenstone…one of them has taken it. One of them is false.

BILBO BAGGINS
Thorin, the quest is fulfilled, you've won the Mountain. Is that not enough?

THORIN
Betrayed by my own kin.

BILBO BAGGINS
No, uh…you…you made a promise to the people of Lake-town. Now is this treasure truly worth more than your honor? Our honor, Thorin. I was also there, I gave my word.

THORIN
For that, I'm grateful. It was nobly done. But the treasure in this Mountain does not belong to the people of Lake-town. This gold…is ours, and ours alone.

THORIN
With my life I will not part with a single coin. Not one piece of it.

TAURIEL
Gundabad. What lies beyond?

LEGOLAS
An old enemy. The ancient Kingdom of Angmar. And this fortress was once its stronghold. It is where they kept their great armories, forged their weapons of war.

TAURIEL
A light. I saw movement.

LEGOLAS
We wait for the cover of night. It is a fell place, Tauriel. In another age our people waged war on those lands.

LEGOLAS
My mother died there. My father does not speak of it. There is no grave, no memory, nothing.

GANDALF
Let me through! Make way!

ALFRID
No, no, no! Oi, you! Pointy hat!

ALFRID
Yes, you. We don't want no tramps, beggars nor vagabonds around here. We've got enough trouble without the likes of you. Off you go. On your horse.

GANDALF
Who's in charge here?

BARD
Who is asking?

GANDALF
You must set aside your petty grievances with the Dwarves. War is coming. The cesspits of Dol Guldur have been emptied. You're all in mortal danger.

BARD
What are you talking about?

THRANDUIL
I can see you know nothing of wizards. They are like winter thunder on a wild wind, rolling in from a distance breaking hard in alarm. But sometimes a storm is just a storm.

GANDALF
Not this time. Armies of Orcs are on the move. These are fighters, they have been bred for war. Our enemy has summoned his full strength.

THRANDUIL
Why show his hand now?

GANDALF
Because we forced him. We forced him when the company of Thorin Oakenshield set out to reclaim their homeland. The Dwarves were never meant to reach Erebor, Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them. His master seeks control of the Mountain, not just for the treasure within, but for where it lies, its strategic position. This is the gateway to reclaiming the lands of Angmar in the North. If that fell Kingdom should rise again Rivendell, Lórien, the Shire even Gondor itself will fall.

THRANDUIL
These Orc armies you speak of, Mithrandir, where are they?

RAGASH
Our army will be in position by dawn. The attack will be sudden and swift!

AZOG
The fools! They have forgotten what lives beneath these lands. They have forgotten the great Earth-eaters.

TAURIEL
If we are going in we should move now.

TAURIEL
They are swarming.

LEGOLAS
These bats are bred for one purpose.

TAURIEL
For what?

LEGOLAS
For war.

TAURIEL
We must warn the others.

LEGOLAS
We may be too late – hurry!

GANDALF
Since when has my council counted for so little? What do you think I'm trying to do?

THRANDUIL
I think you're trying to save your Dwarvish friends. And I admire your loyalty to them. But it does not dissuade me from my cause. You started this, Mithrandir, you will forgive me if I finish it.

THRANDUIL
Are the archers in position?

ELF
Yes, My Lord.

THRANDUIL
Give the order. If anything moves on that mountain, kill it. The Dwarves are out of time.

GANDALF
You, bowman! Do you agree with this? Is gold so important to you? Would you buy it with the blood of Dwarves?

BARD
It will not come to that. This is a fight they cannot win.

BILBO BAGGINS
That won't stop them. You think the Dwarves will surrender? They won't. They will fight to the death to defend their own.

GANDALF
Bilbo Baggins!

THRANDUIL
If I'm not mistaken, this is the Halfling who stole the keys to my dungeons from under the nose of my guards.

BILBO BAGGINS
Yes. Sorry about that. I came to give you this.

THRANDUIL
The Heart of the Mountain. The King's jewel.

BARD
And worth a king's ransom.

BARD
How is this yours to give?

BILBO BAGGINS
I took it as my fourteenth share of the treasure.

BARD
Why would you do this? You owe us no loyalty.

BILBO BAGGINS
I'm not doing it for you. I know that Dwarves can be obstinate and pigheaded and difficult. And suspicious and secretive with the worst manners you can possibly imagine, but they are also brave and kind and loyal to a fault. I've grown very fond of them, and I would save them if I can. But Thorin values this stone above all else. In exchange for its return, I believe he will give you what you were owed. There will be no need for war.

GANDALF
Rest up tonight. You must leave on the morrow.

BILBO BAGGINS
What?

GANDALF
Get as far away from here as possible.

BILBO BAGGINS
I-I'm not leaving.

GANDALF
Oh?

BILBO BAGGINS
You picked me as the fourteenth man. I'm not about to leave the company now.

GANDALF
There is no company, not any more. And I don't like to think what Thorin would do when he finds out what you've done.

BILBO BAGGINS
I'm not afraid of Thorin.

GANDALF
Well, you should be. Don't underestimate the evil of gold. Gold over which a serpent had long brooded. Dragon-sickness seeps into the hearts of all who came to this Mountain. Almost all.

GANDALF
You there! Find this Hobbit a bed and fill his belly with hot food. He's earned it.

GANDALF
Hey. Keep an eye on him. If he should try to leave, you tell me.

ALFRID
Move it. Stupid Hobbit.

ALFRID
Wakey, wakey, Hobbit. Up you…get?

THORIN
I will put the next one between your eyes.

THRANDUIL
We've come to tell you payment of your debt has been offered and accepted.

THORIN
What payment? I gave you nothing. You have nothing.

BARD
We have this.

KILI
They have the Arkenstone. Thieves! How came you by the heirloom of our house? That stone belongs to the king.

BARD
The King may have it, with our good will.

BARD
But first he must honor his word.

THORIN
They're taking us for fools. This is a ruse, and a filthy lie. The Arkenstone is in this Mountain, it is a trick!

BILBO BAGGINS
I-it's no trick. The stone is real. I gave it to them.

THORIN
You?

BILBO BAGGINS
I took it as my fourteenth share.

THORIN
You would steel from me?

BILBO BAGGINS
Steel from you? No, no. I may be a burglar, but I like to think I'm an honest one. I'm willing to let it stand against my claim.

THORIN
Against your claim?

THORIN
Your claim? You have no claim over me, you miserable rat!

BILBO BAGGINS
I was going to give it to you. Many times I wanted to, but…

THORIN
But what, thief?

BILBO BAGGINS
You are changed, Thorin. The Dwarf I met in Bag End would never have gone back on his word, would never have doubted the loyalty of his kin.

THORIN
Do not speak to me of loyalty.

THORIN
Throw him from the rampart!

THORIN
Did you not hear me?! I will do it myself.

THORIN
I curse you!

FILI
No!

THORIN
Cursed be the wizard that forced you on this company!

GANDALF
If you don't like my burglar, then please don't damage him. Return him to me. You're not making a very splendid figure as King under the Mountain, are you, *Thorin, son of Thrain?

THORIN
Never again will I have dealings with wizards!

BOFUR
Go.

THORIN
Or Shire rats!

BARD
Are we resolved? The return of the Arkenstone for what was promised.

BARD
Give us your answer. Will you have peace or war?

THORIN
I will have war.

GANDALF
Ironfoot.

DWARVES
Dain! Dain! Dain!

BILBO BAGGINS
Who is that? He doesn't look very happy.

GANDALF
It is Dain, Lord of the Iron Hills. Thorin's cousin.

BILBO BAGGINS
Are they alike?

GANDALF
I've always found Thorin the more reasonable of the two.

DAIN
Good morning! How are we all? I have a wee proposition, if you wouldn't mind giving me a few moments of your time. Would you consider…

DAIN
Just sodding off?!

DAIN
All of you! Right now!

BARD
Stand fast!

GANDALF
Come now, Lord Dain.

DAIN
Gandalf the Grey. Tell this rabble to leave, or I'll water the ground with their blood.

GANDALF
There is no need for war between Dwarves, Men and Elves. A legion of Orcs march on the Mountain. Stand your army down.

DAIN
I will not stand down before any Elf. Not least this faithless woodland sprite. He wishes nothing but ill upon my people. If he chooses to stand between me and my kin, I'll split his pretty head open! See if he's still smirking then.

DWARVES
Dain!

THRANDUIL
He's clearly mad, like his cousin.

DAIN
You hear that, lads? We're on! Let's give these bastards a good hammering!

GANDALF
Were-worms!

DAIN
Oh, come on!

AZOG
Come forth my Armies!

DAIN
The Hordes of Hell are upon us! To battle! To battle, sons of Durin!

KILI
I'm going over the wall, who's coming with me?

DWARVES
Aye! Yes!

FILI
Come on, let's go.

THORIN
Stand down.

FILI
What? Are we to do nothing?

THORIN
I said stand down!

BILBO BAGGINS
The Elves, will they not fight?

GANDALF
Thranduil! This is madness!

BILBO BAGGINS
Uh, Gandalf, is this a good place to stand?

AZOG
Send in the War Beasts!

AZOG
They cannot fight on two fronts. Now we make our move. Attack the city!

GANDALF
Azog. He's trying to cut us off.

BARD
All of you, fall back to Dale! Now!

GANDALF
To the city! People, this way!

BAIN
Sigrid! Tilda!

BARD
My children! Where are my children?

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN
I saw them, they were down in the Old Market!

BARD
The Market? Where are they now? Tilda! Sigrid!

PERCY
Bard, Orcs are storming over the Causeway.

BARD
Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet. Hold them of for as long as you can.

PERCY
Archers, this way!

LAKE-TOWNER MALE
The Orcs have taken Stone Street, the Market's overrun!

BARD
The rest of you, follow me!

ALFRID
Charge! Onward! To the death!

SIGRID
Da!

TILDA
Da!

SIGRID
Over here!

TILDA
Da we're here!

BARD
Tilda! Bain! Sigrid! Get down!

BARD
Listen, I need you to gather the women and children, take them to the Great Hall and barricade the door. You understand? You must not come out for any reason.

TILDA
We want to stay with you.

ALFRID
Show your father some respect. You leave it to me, Sire.

ALFRID
You heard him, we make to the Great Hall.

BARD
Alfrid, women and children only. I need every man fighting. See that you return.

ALFRID
I'll get them to safety, Sire. Then my sword is yours to command.

ALFRID
Get up!

BARD
Look after them.

BAIN
I will.

ALFRID
Shift it, granny.

BAIN
Make for the Great Hall.

ALFRID
Out of my way! Abandon the cripples!

AZOG
They cannot hold the city! The Dwarves are almost spent.

DAIN
Yer buggers!

DAIN
Thorin! Where's Thorin? We need him. Where is he?

AZOG
Let these lands run with blood! Slaughter them all.

BARD
Fall back!

DWALIN
Since when do we forsake our own people? Thorin, they are dying out there.

THORIN
There are holes beneath holes within this Mountain, places we can fortify. Shore up, make safe? Yes. Yes, that is it. We must move the gold further underground to safety.

DWALIN
Did you not hear me? Dain is surrounded. They're being slaughtered, Thorin.

THORIN
Many die in war, life is cheap. But a treasure such as this cannot be counted in lives lost. It is worth all the blood we can spend.

DWALIN
You sit here in these vast halls with a crown upon your head, and yet you are lesser now than you have ever been.

THORIN
Do not speak to me as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord. As is if I were still Thorin… Oakenshield. I am your King!

DWALIN
You were always my King. You used to know that once. You were always my King. You used to know that once. You cannot see what you have become.

THORIN
Go. Get out, before I kill you.

DWALIN
You sit here with a crown upon your head. You are lesser now than you have ever been.

THORIN
A treasure such as this cannot be counted in lives lost.

BALIN
A sickness lies upon that treasure…

BARD
The blind ambition of a Mountain King.

THORIN
Am I not the King?

THORIN
This gold is ours, and ours alone. Treasure hoard… I will not part with a single coin.

BARD
He could not see beyond his own desire!

THORIN
…as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord. Thorin Oakenshield.

BALIN
A sickness which drove your grandfather mad.

THORIN
Oakenshield.

DWALIN
This is Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror!

THORIN
I am not my grandfather.

GANDALF
You are the heir to the Throne of Durin.

DWALIN
They are dying out there.

GANDALF
Take back Erebor.

DWALIN
Dain is surrounded…is surrounded.

GANDALF
Take back your homeland.

BILBO BAGGINS
You are changed, Thorin.

THORIN
I'm not my grandfather.

BILBO BAGGINS
Is this treasure truly worth more than your honor?

THORIN
I'm not my grandfather.

GANDALF
This treasure will be your death.

DAIN
Fall back! Fall back! Back to the Mountain! Fall back!

AZOG
Now comes their end. Prepare for the final assault.

KILI
I will not hide behind a wall of stone, while others fight our battles for us! It is not in my blood, Thorin.

THORIN
No, it is not. We are sons of Durin, and Durin's folk do not flee from a fight.

THORIN
I have no right to ask this of any of you, but will you follow me, one last time?

AZOG
Not yet! Wait…wait. Attack…now!

BILBO BAGGINS
Thorin.

DAIN
To the King! To the King!

BILBO BAGGINS
The Dwarves, they're rallying.

GANDALF
They're rallying to their King.

BARD
Any man who wants to give their last, follow me!

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN #1
I say we stand with our men in life and in death.

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN #2
I'm with ya.

BAIN
Arm yourselves!

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN #3
Come with us, love.

ALFRID
No, no, no. You leave an old woman be.

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN #3
Don't be afraid.

ALFRID
I said get off!

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN #1
Alfrid Lickspittle, you are a coward.

ALFRID
A Coward? Not every man is brave enough to wear a corset.

LAKE-TOWN WOMAN #1
You're not a man, you're a weasel.

THORIN
Dain!

DAIN
Thorin! Hold on! I'm coming!

DAIN
Hey, cousin, what took you so long?

DAIN
There's too many of these buggers, Thorin. I hope you've got a plan.

THORIN
Aye, we're going to take out their leader.

DAIN
Azog?

THORIN
I'm going to kill that piece of filth.

DWALIN
Lead on!

GANDALF
We may yet survive this.

BILBO BAGGINS
Gandalf!

BILBO BAGGINS
It's Thorin.

GANDALF
And Fili and Kili…and Dwalin. He's taking his best warriors.

BILBO BAGGINS
To do what?

GANDALF
To cut the head of the snake.

DWALIN
Die!

LEGOLAS
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Legolas. Legolas Greenleaf!

LEGOLAS
There is a second army. Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs. They are almost upon us.

GANDALF
Gundabad? Ahh. This was their plan all along. Azog engages our forces, then Bolg sweeps in from the north.

BILBO BAGGINS
What? Th…the north? Where is the north exactly?

GANDALF
Ravenhill.

BILBO BAGGINS
Ravenhill? Thorin is up there. And Fili and Kili! They're all up there!

FILI
Where is he? It looks empty. I think Azog has fled.

THORIN
I don't think so.

THORIN
Fili, take your brother. Scout out the towers. Keep low and out of sight. If you see something, report back, do not engage. Do you understand?

DWALIN
We have company. Goblin mercenaries. No more than a hundred.

THORIN
We'll take care of them.

THORIN
Go! Go!

THRANDUIL
Recall your company.

GANDALF
My Lord, disperse this force to Ravenhill, the Dwarves are about to be overrun. Thorin must be warned.

THRANDUIL
By all means, warn him. I've spent enough Elvish blood in defense of this accursed land. No more!

GANDALF
Thranduil?

BILBO BAGGINS
I'll go.

GANDALF
Don't be ridiculous, you'll never make it.

BILBO BAGGINS
Why not?

GANDALF
Because they will see you coming, and kill you!

BILBO BAGGINS
No, they won't. They won't see me.

GANDALF
It's out of the question. I won't allow it.

BILBO BAGGINS
I'm not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.

TAURIEL
You will go no further.

TAURIEL
You will not turn away. Not this time.

THRANDUIL
Get out of my way.

TAURIEL
The Dwarves will be slaughtered.

THRANDUIL
Yes, they will die. Today, tomorrow, one year hence, a hundred years from now. What does it matter? They are mortal.

TAURIEL
You think your life is worth more than theirs, while there is no love in it? There is no love in you.

THRANDUIL
What do you know of love? Nothing. What you feel for that Dwarf is not real. You think it is love? Are you ready to die for it?

LEGOLAS
If you harm her you will have to kill me.

LEGOLAS
I will go with you.

BARD
Get up.

ALFRID
Get away from me. I don't take orders from you. People trusted you, they listened to you. The Master's mantle was there for the taking and you threw it all away. For what?

BARD
Alfrid…your slip is showing.

FILI
Stay here, search the lower levels. I've got this.

DWALIN
Where is that Orc filth?

BILBO BAGGINS
Thorin!

THORIN
Bilbo.

BILBO BAGGINS
You have to leave here. Now! Azog has another army, attacking from the north. This watchtower will be completely surrounded, there'll be no way out.

DWALIN
We are so close. That Orc scum is in there. I say we push on.

THORIN
No! That's what he wants. He wants to draw us in. This is a trap.

THORIN
Find Fili and Kili, call them back.

DWALIN
Thorin, are you sure about this?

THORIN
Do it. We live to fight another day.

BILBO BAGGINS
Oh no.

AZOG
This one dies first. Then the brother. Then you, Oakenshield. You will die last.

FILI
Go. Run!

AZOG
Here ends your filthy bloodline!

THORIN
Kili!

DWALIN
Thorin! Thorin, no.

BOLG
Slay them all!

TAURIEL
No. Kili!

AZOG
Go in for the kill! Finish him!

TAURIEL
Kili! Kili!

KILI
Tauriel!

TAURIEL
Kili.

TAURIEL
No!

TAURIEL
No! No.

LEGOLAS
Tauriel!

BILBO BAGGINS
The eagles are coming.

THORIN
Bilbo.

BILBO BAGGINS
No, don't look. Don't move. Lie still.

BILBO BAGGINS
Oh!

THORIN
I'm glad you're here.

BILBO BAGGINS
Shh, shh, shh, shh…

THORIN
I wish to part from you in friendship.

BILBO BAGGINS
No, you are not going anywhere, Thorin, you're going to live.

THORIN
I would take back my words and my deeds at the gate. You did what only a true friend would do. Forgive me. I was too blind to see. I am so sorry that I have led you into such peril.

BILBO BAGGINS
No, I…I'm glad to have shared in your perils, Thorin. Each and every one of them. It is far more than any Baggins deserves.

THORIN
Farewell, Master Burglar. Go back to your books and your armchair. Plant your trees, watch them grow. If more people valued home above gold, this world would be a merrier place.

BILBO BAGGINS
No! No, no, no, no! No! Thorin! Thorin, don't you dare…

BILBO BAGGINS
Thorin? Look, Thorin. Thorin, hold on. You hold on. You see, the Eagles… the Eagles, the Eagles are here. Thorin…the Eag…

LEGOLAS
I…cannot go back.

THRANDUIL
Where will you go?

LEGOLAS
I do not know.

THRANDUIL
Go north. Find the Dunedain. There is a young ranger amongst them, you should meet him. His father Arathorn was a good man. His son might grow to be a great one.

LEGOLAS
What is his name?

THRANDUIL
He is known in the wild as Strider. His true name you must discover for yourself.

THRANDUIL
Legolas, your mother loved you, more than anyone, more than life.

TAURIEL
I want to bury him.

THRANDUIL
Yes.

TAURIEL
If this is love, I do not want it. Take it from me, please! Why does it hurt so much?

THRANDUIL
Because it was real.

BALIN
There is to be a great feast tonight. Songs will be sung, tales will be told, and Thorin Oakenshield will pass into legend.

BILBO BAGGINS
I know that's how you must honor him, but to me, he was never that. He was…to me…he was…

BILBO BAGGINS
Well, I think I'll slip quietly away, will you tell the others I said goodbye?

BALIN
You can tell them yourself.

BILBO BAGGINS
If any of you are ever passing Bag-End, uh…tea is at four. There's plenty of it, you are welcome any time.

BILBO BAGGINS
Uh…don't bother knocking.

GANDALF
Ah, the borders of the Shire. It is here I must leave you.

BILBO BAGGINS
That's a shame. I quite liked having a wizard around. It seems they bring good luck.

GANDALF
You don't really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck. Magic rings should not be used lightly, Bilbo. Don't take me for a fool, I know you found one…

BILBO BAGGINS
No.

GANDALF
In the Goblin tunnels, and I've kept my eye on you ever since.

BILBO BAGGINS
Well, thank goodness. Farewell, Gandalf.

GANDALF
Farewell.

BILBO BAGGINS
You, uh…you needn't worry about that ring, it fell out of my pocket during the battle. I lost it.

GANDALF
You're a very fine person, Mr Baggins, and I'm very fond of you. But you're only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all.

BILBO BAGGINS
Wait a minute, that my mother's glory box. And that's…my dining chair.

BILBO BAGGINS
Uh…put that poof down! What is going on?

MASTER WORRYWORT
Hello, mister Bilbo. You're not supposed to be here.

BILBO BAGGINS
What do you mean?

MASTER WORRYWORT
On account of you being presumed dead and all.

BILBO BAGGINS
I am not dead, presumed or otherwise.

MASTER WORRYWORT
I'm not sure that's permitted! Mister Bilbo!

TOSSER GRUB
…anyone. Any advance on twenty-one? Any advance on twenty-one? Sold to *Mrs. Bolder! Somewhere for Fatty to put his feet on.

TOSSER GRUB
So do I have any bids for this. This is Shire-made. None of your Dwarvish reproductions here, honestly.

BILBO BAGGINS
Stop! Stop! There's been a mistake!

LOBELIA SACKVILLE BAGGINS
Who are you?

BILBO BAGGINS
What do you mean “who am I?” You know perfectly well who I am, Lobelia Sackville Baggins. This is my home. And those are my spoons, thank you very much.

TOSSER GRUB
This is most irregular. It's been more than thirteen months since the disappearance, if you are in fact Bilbo Baggins and un-deceased. Can you prove it?

BILBO BAGGINS
What?

TOSSER GRUB
Well, uh, something official with your name on it would suffice.

BILBO BAGGINS
Alright. Right!

BILBO BAGGINS
A contract of employment as a…a bu… Never mind as to what.

BILBO BAGGINS
There, my signature.

TOSSER GRUB
Yes, well…uh… Oh, it certainly seems to be in order. Yes, it seems there can be no doubt.

TOSSER GRUB
Who is this person you pledged your service to? Thorin Oakenshield?

BILBO BAGGINS
He was my friend.
