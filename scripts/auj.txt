OLD BILBO
My dear Frodo, you asked me once if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures.
And while I can honestly say I have told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it.
I am old now Frodo. I'm not the same hobbit I once was. I think it is time for you to know what really happened.

OLD BILBO
It began long ago in a land far away to the East. The like of which you will not find in the world today.

OLD BILBO
There was the city of Dale. Its markets known far and wide, full of the bounties of vine and vale,
peaceful and prosperous. For this city lay before the doors of the greatest kingdom in Middle-Earth, Erebor.
Stronghold of Thror, king under the mountain. The mightiest of the dwarf lords. Thror ruled with utter surety,
never doubting his house would endure, for his line lay secure in the lives of his son and grandson.

OLD BILBO
Ah, Frodo. Erebor. Built deep within the mountain itself, the beauty of this fortress city was legend.
Its wealth lay in the earth, in precious gems hewn from rock, and in great seams of gold running like rivers through stone.
The skill of the dwarves was unequaled. Fashioning objects of great beauty, out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire.

OLD BILBO
Ever they delved deeper down into the dark, and that is where they found it. The heart of the mountain, the Arkenstone.
Thror named it the king's jewel. He took it as a sign, a sign that his right to rule was divine.

OLD BILBO
All would pay homage to him. Even the great Elven king, Thranduil. But the years of peace and plenty were not to last.
Slowly the days turned sour, and the watchful nights closed in.

OLD BILBO
Thror's love of gold had grown too fierce. A sickness had begun to grow within him.
It was a sickness of the mind. And where sickness thrives bad things will follow.

OLD BILBO
The first they heard was a noise like a hurricane, coming down from the North.
The pines on the mountain creaked and cracked in the hot dry wind.

THORIN
Balin, sound the alarm. Call out the guards, do it now!

BALIN
What is it?

THORIN
Dragon. Dragon!

OLD BILBO
He was a Firedrake from the North.

OLD BILBO
Smaug had come!

OLD BILBO
Such wanton death was dealt that day, for this city of men was nothing to Smaug.
His eye was set on another prize. For dragons covet gold with a dark and fierce desire.

THROR
No!

OLD BILBO
Erebor was lost. For a dragon will guard his plunder as long as he lives.

THORIN
Run for your lives!

THORIN
Help us!

OLD BILBO
Thranduil would not risk the lives of his kin against the wrath of the dragon.
No help came from the Elves that day. Nor any day since.

OLD BILBO
Robbed of their homeland, the dwarves of Erebor wandered the wilderness.
The once mighty people brought low. The young dwarf prince took work where he could find it,
laboring in the villages of men. But always, he remembered the mountain smoke beneath the moon,
the trees like torches blazing bright, where he had seen dragon fire in the sky, and a city turn to ash.
And he never forgave, and he never forgot.

STOP

OLD BILBO
That, my dear Frodo, is where I come in. For quite by chance, and the will of a wizard,
fate decided I would become part of this tale. It began as you might expect.

OLD BILBO
In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty wet hole full of worms and oozy smells.
This was a hobbit hole. And that means good food, a warm hearth, and all the comforts of home.

STOP

OLD BILBO
Thank you.

FRODO
What's this?

OLD BILBO
That is private. Keep your sticky paws off!

OLD BILBO
It's not ready yet.

FRODO
Not ready for what?

OLD BILBO
Reading.

OLD BILBO
What on earth are these?

FRODO
Replies to the party invitations.

OLD BILBO
Ah! Good gracious! Is it today?

FRODO
They all say they're coming, except for the Sackville-Bagginses, who are demanding you ask them in person.

OLD BILBO
Are they, indeed. Over my dead body.

FRODO
They'd probably find that quite agreeable. They seem to think you have tunnels overflowing with gold.

OLD BILBO
It was one small chest, hardly overflowing. And it still smells of troll.

FRODO
What on earth are you doing?

OLD BILBO
Taking precautions. You know I caught her making off with the silverware once.

FRODO
Who?

OLD BILBO
Lobelia Sackville-Baggins. She had all my spoons stuffed in her pockets. Dreadful woman.
Make sure you keep an eye on her after I'm-

FRODO
When you're what?

OLD BILBO
It's nothing. Nothing.

FRODO
You know, some people are beginning to wonder about you, uncle.
They think you're becoming odd.

OLD BILBO
Odd?

FRODO
Well, unsociable.

OLD BILBO
Unsociable, me? Nonsense. Be a good lad and put that on the gate.

FRODO
Do you think he'll come?

OLD BILBO
Who?

FRODO
Gandalf.

OLD BILBO
Oh, he wouldn't miss a chance to let off his whiz poppers. He'll give us quite a show, you'll see.

FRODO
Right then. I am off.

OLD BILBO
Off to where?

FRODO
Eastfarthing woods. I'm going to surprise him.

OLD BILBO
Well, go on then. You don't want to be late.

OLD BILBO
He doesn't approve being late. Not that I ever was. In those days, I was always on time.
I was entirely respectable, and nothing unexpected- ever happened.

STOP

BILBO
Good morning.

GANDALF
What do you mean? Do you mean to wish me a good morning,
or do you mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not?
Or perhaps you mean to say that you feel good on this particular morning?
Or are you simply stating that this is a morning to be good on?

BILBO
All of them at once, I suppose.

BILBO
Can I help you?

GANDALF
It remains to be seen. I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure.

BILBO
An adventure? No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree, would have much interest in adventures.
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things. Make you late for dinner!

BILBO
Good morning!

GANDALF
To think that I should have lived to be good- morninged by Belladonna Took's son,
as if I was selling buttons at the door!

BILBO
Beg your pardon?

GANDALF
You've changed, and not entirely for the better, Bilbo Baggins.

BILBO
I'm sorry, do I know you?

GANDALF
Well you know my name, although you don't remember I belong to it.
I'm Gandalf, and Gandalf means me!

BILBO
Gandalf? Not Gandalf, the wandering wizard who made such excellent fireworks?
Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve! Well! I had no idea you were still in business.

GANDALF
And where else should I be?

BILBO
Well-

GANDALF
Well, I'm pleased to find you remember something about me, even if it's only my fireworks.

GANDALF
Well that's decided. It'll be very good for you, and most amusing for me. I shall inform the others.

BILBO
Inform the who? What? No! No! No, wait.

BILBO
We do not want any adventures here, thank you!
I suggest you try over the hill or across the water. Good morning.

STOP

DWALIN
Dwalin.

DWALIN
At your service.

BILBO
Hm. Bilbo Baggins at yours.

BILBO
Do we know each other?

DWALIN
No. Which way, laddie? Is it down here?

BILBO
Is- is what down where?

DWALIN
Supper.

DWALIN
He said there'd be food, and lots of it.

BILBO
He- he said? Who said?

DWALIN
Very good this. Any more?

BILBO
What? Oh- yes, yes.

BILBO
Help yourself.

BILBO
Hmm. It's just that, I wasn't expecting company.

DWALIN
That'll be the door.

BALIN
Balin. At your service.

BILBO
Good evening.

BALIN
Yes. Yes, it is. Although I think it might rain later.

BALIN
Am I late?

BILBO
Late for what?

BALIN
Ooh! Ah-hah! Evening, brother!

DWALIN
By my beard! You are shorter and wider than last we met.

BALIN
Wider, not shorter. Sharp enough for both of us.

BILBO
Excuse me. Sorry. I hate to interrupt. But the thing is I'm not entirely sure you're in the right house.

BALIN
Have you eaten?

BILBO
It's not that I don't like visitors. I like visitors as much as the next Hobbit. But I do like to know them before they come visiting.

DWALIN
What is this?

BALIN
I don't know. I think it's supposed to be cheese, it's gone blue.

BILBO
The thing is, um-

DWALIN
It's riddled with mold.

BILBO
The thing is, I don't know either of you, not in the slightest. I don't mean to be blunt, but I had to speak my mind. I'm sorry.

BALIN
Apology accepted.

BILBO
Well-

BALIN
Oh, no. Fill it up now, brother, don't stint.

DWALIN
You want to get stuck in?

BALIN
I could eat again if you insist, brother.

FILI
Fili.

KILI
And Kili.

FILI & KILI
At your service.

KILI
You must be Mister Baggins.

BILBO
No! You can't come in, you've come to the wrong house.

KILI
What? Has it been canceled?

FILI
No one told us.

BILBO
Can-? No, nothing's been canceled.

KILI
That's a relief.

FILI
Careful with these, I just had them sharpened.

KILI
It's nice, this place. Did you do it yourself?

BILBO
No, it's been in the family for years.

BILBO
That's my mother's glory box, can you please not do that?

DWALIN
Fili, Ki­li, come on, give us a hand.

KILI
Mister Dwalin.

BALIN
Let's shove this in the hole, or otherwise we'll never get everyone in.

BILBO
Ev- everyone? How many more are there?

BILBO
Oh, no! No, no. There's nobody home! Go away, and bother somebody else!
There's far too many dwarves in my dining room as it is. If this is some blockhead's idea of a joke,
I can only say, it is in very poor taste!

BILBO
Gandalf.

STOP

BILBO
Those are my-! Excuse me, not my wine! Put that back. Put that back! Not the jam, please. Excuse me.

BILBO
Ex- Excuse me. A tad excessive, isn't it? Have you got a cheese knife?

BOFUR
A cheese knife? He eats it by the block.

BILBO
No no, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair, no-, so is that. Take it back, please.
Take it back, this is antique, not for sitting on. Thank you. That is a book, not a coaster. Uh- put that map down.

DORI
Excuse me, Mister Gandalf.

GANDALF
Yes?

DORI
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile?

GANDALF
Ooh, no thank you, Dori. A little red wine, for me I think.

GANDALF
Fili, Kili. Oin, Gloin. Dwalin, Balin. Bifur, Bofur, Bombur. Dori, Nori.

BILBO
No, no. Not my prize winners, thank you.

GANDALF
Ori!

GANDALF
Yes, you are quite right, Bifur. We appear to be one dwarf short.

DWALIN
He is late, is all. He traveled north to a meeting of our kin, he will come.

DORI
Mister Gandalf?

GANDALF
Hmm?

DORI
A little glass of red wine as requested, it's got a fruity bouquet.

GANDALF
Oh, cheers.

FILI
Who wants an ale? There you go.

OIN
Let me have another drink.

BALIN
Here you go.

BOFUR
Hey, on the count of three! One! Two! Come!

BILBO
Ex- excuse me, that is a doily, not a dish cloth.

BOFUR
But it's full of holes!

BILBO
It's supposed to look like that, it's crochet.

BOFUR
Oh, and a wonderful game it is too, if you got the balls for it.

BILBO
Bebother and confusticate these dwarves!

GANDALF
My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the matter?

BILBO
What's the matter? I am surrounded by dwarves. What they're doing here?

GANDALF
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering, once you get used to them.

BILBO
I don't want to get used to them. Look at the state of my kitchen!
There's mud trod in the carpet, they've pillaged the pantry!
I'm not even gonna tell you what they've done in the bathroom, they've all but destroyed the plumbing!
I don't understand what they're doing in my house!

ORI
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt. But what should do with my plate?

FILI
Here you go, Ori, give it to me.

BILBO
Excuse me! That's my mother's Westfarthing pottery, it's over a hundred years old!

BILBO
And, can you not do that, you'll blunt them!

BOFUR
Ooh, d'you hear that, lads? He says we'll blunt the knives!

KILI
Blunt the knives, bend the forks.

FILI
Smash the bottles and burn the corks.

DWARVES
Chip the glasses and crack the plates. That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!
Cut the cloth and tread on the fat. Leave the bones on the bedroom-mat,
pour the milk on the pantry-floor, splash the wine on every door, dump the crocks in a boiling bowl,
pound them up with a thumping pole. When you've finished, if any are whole, send them down the hall to roll!

DWARVES
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!

GANDALF
He's here.

THORIN
Gandalf. I thought you said this place would be easy to find. I lost my way, twice.

BALIN
What news from the meeting in Ered Luin? Did they all come?

THORIN
Aye, envoys from all seven kingdoms.

DWALIN
And what did the dwarves of the Iron Hill say? Is Dain with us?

THORIN
They will not come.

THORIN
They say this quest is ours, and ours alone.

BILBO
You're doing a quest?

GANDALF
Bilbo, my dear fellow, let us have a little more light.

GANDALF
Far to the East, over ranges and rivers, beyond woodlands and wastelands, lies a single solitary peak.

BILBO
The Lonely Mountain.

GLOIN
Aye, Oin has read the portents, and the portents say
it is time.

OIN
Ravens have been seen flying back to the mountain as it was foretold.
When the birds of the old return to Erebor, the reign of the beast will end.

BILBO
What beast?

BOFUR
Well that would be a reference to Smaug the Terrible, chiefest and greatest calamity of our age.
Airborne fire breather, teeth like razors, claws like meat hooks, extremely fond of precious metals.

BILBO
Yes, I know what a dragon is.

ORI
I'm not afraid, I'm up for it. I'll give him a taste of the dwarfish iron right up his jacksy!

DORI
Sit down!

BALIN
The task would be difficult enough with an army behind us, but we number just thirteen, and not thirteen of the best, nor brightest.

ORI
Hey! Who are you calling dim?

FILI
We may be few in number. But we're fighters, all of us! To the last dwarf!

KILI
And you forget we have a wizard in our company, Gandalf will have killed hundreds of dragons in his time.

GANDALF
Oh, well. No, uh, I wouldn't say-

DORI
How many then?

GANDALF
What?

DORI
Well, how many dragons have you killed? Go on, give us a number!

BILBO
Please. Please.

THORIN
Enough!

THORIN
If we have read these signs, do you not think others will have read them too? Rumors have begun to spread.
The dragon Smaug has not been seen for sixty years. Eyes look East to the mountain, assessing, wondering,
weighing the risk. Perhaps the vast wealth of our people now lies unprotected.
Do we sit back while others claim what is rightfully ours? Or do we seize this chance to take back Erebor?

BALIN
You forget the front gate is sealed. There is no way into the mountain.

GANDALF
That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.

THORIN
How came you by this?

GANDALF
It was given to me by your father by Thrain, for safekeeping. It is yours now.

FILI
If there is a key, there must be a door!

GANDALF
These runes speak of a hidden passage to the lower halls.

KILI
There's another way in.

GANDALF
Well, if we can find it, but dwarf doors are invisible when closed. The answer lies hidden somewhere in this map,
and I do not have the skill to find it, but there are others in Middle-Earth who can.
The task I have in mind will require a great deal of stealth, and no small amount of courage.
But if we're careful and clever, I believe that it can be done.

ORI
That's why we need a burglar.

BILBO
Hmm. And a good one too. An expert, I'd imagine.

GLOIN
And are you?

BILBO
Am I what?

OIN
He said he's an expert!

BILBO
Me? No! No, No, No! I'm not a burglar. I've never stolen a thing in my life.

BALIN
And I'm afraid I have to agree with Mister Baggins. He's hardly burglar material.

DWALIN
Aye, the wild is no place for gentle folk who can neither fight nor fend for themselves.

GANDALF
Enough! If I say Bilbo Baggins is a burglar, then a burglar he is! Hobbits are remarkably light on their feet.
In fact, they can pass unseen by most if they choose, and while the dragon is accustomed to the smell of a dwarf,
the scent of a hobbit is all but unknown to him, which gives us a distinct advantage.
You asked me to find the fourteenth member of this company, and I have chosen Mister Baggins.
There's a lot more to him than appearances suggest.
And he's got a great deal more to offer than any of you know, including himself.

GANDALF
You must trust me on this.

THORIN
Very well. We'll do it your way.

BILBO
No. No-

THORIN
Give him the contract.

BOFUR
Orin. We're off!

BILBO
Please.

BALIN
It's just the usual summary of out-of-pocket expenses, time required, remuneration, funeral arrangements, so forth.

BILBO
Funeral arrangements? Ooh.

THORIN
I cannot guarantee his safety.

GANDALF
Understood.

THORIN
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.

GANDALF
Agreed.

BILBO
'Total's cash on delivery, up to but not exceeding, one fourteenth of total profit if any.'
Seems fair.

BILBO
'The present company shall not be liable for injuries inflicted by or sustained as a consequence thereof,
including, but not limited to- lacerations. Evisceration.'

BILBO
'Incineration'?

BOFUR
Oh, aye, he'll melt the flesh off your bones in the blink of an eye.

BALIN
You alright, laddie?

BILBO
Huh? Yeah, I feel a bit faint.

BOFUR
Think furnace, with wings.

BILBO
I- I need air.

BOFUR
Flash of light, searing pain, then poof! You're nothing more than a pile of ash!

BILBO
No.

GANDALF
Oh, very helpful, Bofur.

BILBO
I'll be alright. Just let me sit quietly for a moment.

GANDALF
You've been sitting quietly for far too long. Tell me, when did doilies and your mother's dishes become so important to you?
I remember a young hobbit who was always running off in search of Elves, in the woods.
He'd stay out late, come home, after dark, trailing mud and twigs and fireflies.
A young hobbit who would've liked nothing better than to find out what was beyond the borders of the Shire.
The world is not in your books and maps. It's out there.

BILBO
I can't just go running off into the blue! I am a Baggins, of Bag End!

GANDALF
You are also a Took. Did you know that your great, great, great,
great uncle Bullroarer Took, was so large he could ride a real horse?

GANDALF
Yes, well he could! In the battle of Greenfields, he charged the goblin ranks he swung his club so hard,
it knocked the goblin king's head clean off, and it sailed a hundred yards through the air, and went down a rabbit hole.
And thus the battle as won, and the game of golf invented at the same time.

BILBO
I do believe you made that up.

GANDALF
Well, all good stories deserve embellishment. You'll have a tale or two to tell of your own when you come back.

BILBO
Can you promise that I will come back?

GANDALF
No. And if you do, you'll not be the same.

BILBO
That's what I thought.

BILBO
Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this. You've got the wrong hobbit.

STOP

BALIN
It appears we have lost our burglar. Probably for the best. The odds were always against us.
After all, what are we? Merchants, miners, tinkers, toy makers. Hardly the stuff of legend.

THORIN
There are a few warriors amongst us.

BALIN
Old warriors.

THORIN
I would take each and every one of these dwarves over an army from the Iron Hills,
for when I called upon them, they answered. Loyalty, honor, a willing heart. I can ask no more than that.

BALIN
You don't have to do this. You have a choice. You've done honorably by our people.
You have built a new life for us in the Blue Mountains. A life of peace and plenty.
A life that is worth more than all the gold in Erebor.

THORIN
From my grandfather to my father, this has come to me.
They dreamt of the day when the dwarves of Erebor would reclaim their homeland. There is no choice, Balin. Not for me.

BALIN
Then we are with you, laddie. We will see it done.

THORIN
Far over the Misty Mountains cold. To dungeons deep and caverns old. We must away ere break of day. To find our long forgotten gold.

DWARVES
The pines were roaring on the height, the winds were moaning in the night.
The fire was red, it flaming spread. The trees like torches blazed with light.

STOP

BILBO
Hello!

HOBBIT
Here, Mister Bilbo! Where are you off too?

BILBO
I can't stop, I'm already late!

HOBBIT
Late for what?

BILBO
I'm going on an adventure!

STOP

BILBO
Wait! Wait!

BILBO
I signed it.

BALIN
Everything appears to be in order. Welcome, master Baggins, to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.

THORIN
Give him a pony.

BILBO
No, no, no, no. That won't be necessary. Thank you. I'm sure I can keep up on foot.
Yeah, I've done my fair share of walking holidays, you know? Even got as far as Frog Morton once.

OIN
Come on, Nori! Pay up!

BILBO
What's that about?

GANDALF
Oh, they took wagers on whether or not you'd turn up. Most of them bet that you wouldn't.

BILBO
And what did you think?

GANDALF
Well my dear fellow, I never doubted you for a second.

BILBO
Oh, it's horse hair. Having a reaction.

BILBO
Wait, wait. Stop! Stop! We have to turn around.

GANDALF
What on earth is the matter?

BILBO
I forgot my handkerchief.

BOFUR
Here! Use this.

THORIN
Move on!

GANDALF
You'll have to manage without pocket handkerchiefs, and a good many other things,
Bilbo Baggins, before we reach our journey's end. You were born to the rolling hills and little rivers of the Shire.
But home is now behind you. The world is ahead.

STOP

BILBO
Good girl! Here's a good girl. It's our little secret, Myrtle. Just tell no one. Shh-shh.

BILBO
What was that?

KILI
Orcs.

BILBO
Orcs?

FILI
Throat cutters. There'd be dozens of them out there. The low lands are crawling with them.

KILI
They strike, in the wee small hours, when everyone's asleep. Quick and quiet, no screams. Just lots of blood.

THORIN
You think that's funny? You think a night raid by orcs is a joke?

KILI
We didn't mean anything by it.

THORIN
No you didn't. You know nothing of the world.

BALIN
Don't mind him, laddie. Thorin has more cause than most to hate orcs.

STOP

BALIN
After the dragon took the Lonely Mountain, King Thror tried to reclaim the ancient dwarf kingdom of Moria.

BALIN
But our enemy had got' there first.

BALIN
Moria had been taken by legions of orcs, led by the most vile of all their race, Azog the Defiler.
The giant Gundabad orc had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin. He began by beheading the king.

BALIN
Thrain, Thorin's father, was driven mad by grief, he went missing, taken prisoner or killed, we did not know.
We were leaderless. Defeat and death were upon us. That is when I saw him. A young dwarf prince facing down the Pale Orc.

BALIN
He stood alone against this terrible foe. His armor rent, wielding nothing but an oaken branch as a shield.

BALIN
Azog the Defiler learned that day, that the line of Durin would not be so easily broken.

BALIN
Our forces rallied, and drove the orcs back. Our enemy had been defeated, but there was no feast,
nor song that night for our dead were beyond the count of grief. We few, had survived.

BALIN
And I thought to myself then, there is one who I could follow, there is one I could call king.

BILBO
And the Pale Orc? What happened to him?

THORIN
He slunk back into the hole whence he came. That filth died of his wounds long ago.

HUNTER ORC
Send word to the Master, we have found the Dwarf-scum.

STOP

DORI
Here, Mister Gandalf? Can't you do something about this deluge?

GANDALF
It is raining, master dwarf. And it will continue to rain until the rain is done!
If you wish to change the weather of the world, you should find yourself another wizard.

BILBO
Are there any?

GANDALF
What?

BILBO
Other wizards?

GANDALF
There are five us. The greatest of our order is Saruman, The White.
Then there are the two blue wizards. Do you know, I've quite forgotten their names.

BILBO
And who is the fifth?

GANDALF
Well, that would be Radagast, The Brown.

BILBO
Is he a great wizard or is he- more like you?

GANDALF
I think he's a very great wizard, in his own way. He's a gentle soul who prefers the company of animals to others.
He keeps a watchful eye over the vast forestlands to the East, and a good thing too,
for always evil will look to find a foothold in this world.

STOP

RADAGAST
Not good. Not good at all!

RADAGAST
Oh. Oh, no! Oh, Sebastian! Good gracious.

RADAGAST
Move back! Give him some air, for goodness sake!

RADAGAST
I don't understand why it's not working, it's not as if it's witchcraft!

RADAGAST
Witchcraft. Oh, but it is! A dark and powerful magic.

RADAGAST
Where on this good earth do those foul creatures come from?

RADAGAST
The old fortress? Show me.

STOP

THORIN
We'll camp here for the night. Fili, Kili, look after the ponies. Make sure you stay with them.

GANDALF
A farmer and his family used to live here.

THORIN
Oin, Gloin.

OIN
Aye?

THORIN
Get the fire going.

OIN
Right you are.

GANDALF
I think it would be wiser to move on. We could make for the hidden valley.

THORIN
But I've told you already. I will not go near that place.

GANDALF
Why not? The Elves could help us, we could get food, rest, advice.

THORIN
I do not need their advice.

GANDALF
We have a map that we cannot read. Lord Elrond could help us.

THORIN
Help? A dragon attacks Erebor. What help came from the Elves? Orcs plunder Moria,
desecrate our sacred halls, the Elves looked on and did nothing!
You ask me to seek out the very people who betrayed my grandfather, who betrayed my father.

GANDALF
You are neither of them. I did not give you that map and key for you to hold on to the past.

THORIN
I did not know they were yours to keep.

BILBO
Everything alright? Gandalf, where are you going?

GANDALF
To seek the company of the only one around here who's got any sense.

BILBO
And who's that?

GANDALF
Myself, Mister Baggins! I've had enough of dwarves for one day.

THORIN
Come on Bombur, we're hungry.

BILBO
Is he coming back?

BILBO
He's been a long time.

BOFUR
Who?

BILBO
Gandalf.

BOFUR
He's a wizard! He does as he chooses. Here. Do us a favor, take this to the lads.

BOFUR
Stop it, you've had plenty.

BILBO
What's the matter?

KILI
We're supposed to be looking after the ponies.

FILI
Only we've encountered a slight problem.

KILI
We had sixteen.

FILI
Now there's fourteen.

KILI
Daisy and Bungle are missing.

BILBO
What? Well, that's not good. And that is not good at all. Shouldn't we tell Thorin?

FILI
Uh- no. Let's not worry him. As our official burglar, we thought you might like to look into it.

BILBO
Well, it looks as if something big uprooted these trees.

KILI
That was our thinking.

BILBO
It's something very big, and possibly quite dangerous.

FILI
Hey! There's a light.

FILI
Over here!

FILI
Stay down.

BILBO
What is it?

KILI
Trolls.

BILBO
He's got Myrtle and Minty! I think they're gonna eat them, we have to do something.

KILI
Yes, you should. Mountain trolls are slow and stupid, and you're so small. They'll never see you.

BILBO
Me? Me? No. No. No.

KILI
It's perfectly safe!

FILI
We'll be right behind you. If you run into trouble hoot twice like a barn owl, once like a brown owl.

BILBO
Twice like a barn owl, hoot twice like a brown- hoots like a-? Are you sure this is a good idea?

STOP

WILLIAM TROLL
Mutton yesterday, mutton today. And blimey, if it don't look like mutton again tomorrow.

BERT TROLL
Quit your griping. These ain't sheep! These is West nags!

TOM TROLL
Oh! I don't like horse. I never have. Not enough fat on them.

WILLIAM TROLL
Well, it's better than a leathery ol' farmer. All skin and bone he was. I'm still pickin' bits of him out o' me teeth.

BERT TROLL
Well, that's lovely, that is. A floater.

WILLIAM TROLL
Oh! Might improve the flavor!

TOM TROLL
Ah! There's more where that came from.

BERT TROLL
Oh, no you don't!

TOM TROLL
Oww! Oww!

BERT TROLL
Sit down!

TOM TROLL
Well I hope you're gonna gut these nags? I don't like the stinky parts.

TOM TROLL
Oww!

BERT TROLL
I said sit down!

WILLIAM TROLL
I'm starving, are we having horse tonight or what?

BERT TROLL
Shut your cake hole! You'll eat what I'll give ya!

WILLIAM TROLL
How come he's the cook? Everything tastes the same, everything tastes like chicken.

TOM TROLL
Except the chicken.

WILLIAM TROLL
What tastes like fish!

BERT TROLL
I'm just saying, a little appreciation would be nice. ‘Thank you very much, Bert. Lovely stew, Bert.' How hard is that?

BERT TROLL
Mmm. Just needs a sprinkle of squirrel dung.

BERT TROLL
Here, that's my grog!

TOM TROLL
Sorry.

TOM TROLL
Oww!

BERT TROLL
Ooh. That is beautifully balanced, that is. Wrap your loganbie around that, mate.

BERT TROLL
Huh? Good ain't it? That's why I'm the cook.

WILLIAM TROLL
Me guts are grumbling, I've got to snaffle something. Flesh. I need flesh!

TOM TROLL
Aah! Blimey! Bert! Bert, look what's come out of me hooter! It's got arms and legs and everything!

BERT TROLL
What is it?

TOM TROLL
I don't know, but I don't like the way it wriggles around!

BERT TROLL
What are you then? An oversized squirrel?

BILBO
I'm a burglar- a hobbit!

TOM TROLL
A ‘burglar-hobbit'?

WILLIAM TROLL
Can we cook him?

TOM TROLL
We can try!

BERT TROLL
He wouldn't make more than a mouthful. Not when he's skinned and boned!

WILLIAM TROLL
Perhaps there's more burglar-hobbits 'round these parts, might be enough for a pie!

WILLIAM TROLL
Grab him!

TOM TROLL
He's too quick!

WILLIAM TROLL
Oah, come here! you little-

WILLIAM TROLL
Gotcha! Are there any more of you little fellas hiding where you shouldn't?

BILBO
No.

TOM TROLL
He's lying!

BILBO
I'm not!

TOM TROLL
Hold his toes over the fire. Make him squeal!

KILI
Drop him!

WILLIAM TROLL
You what?

KILI
I said, drop him.

KILI
Bilbo!

THORIN
No!

WILLIAM TROLL
Lay down your arms! Or we'll rip his off!

TOM TROLL
Don't bother cooking 'em! Let's just sit on 'em and squash 'em into jelly!

BERT TROLL
They should be sauteed and grilled with a sprinkle of sage.

TOM TROLL
Oh, that does sound quite nice.

WILLIAM TROLL
Never mind the seasoning, we ain't got all night! Dawn ain't far away, let's get a move on! I don't fancy been turned to stone.

BILBO
Wait! You are making a terrible mistake.

DORI
You can't reason with them, they're half-wits!

BOFUR
Half-wits? What does that make us?

BILBO
I meant with the, with the- with the seasoning.

BERT TROLL
What about the seasoning?

BILBO
Well, have you smelt them? You're gonna need something stronger than sage before you plate this lot up!

WILLIAM TROLL
What do you know about cooking dwarf?

BERT TROLL
Shut up, and let the- flurgerburbur-hobbit talk.

BILBO
Uh, the secret to cooking dwarf, is-

BERT TROLL
Yes? Come on.

BILBO
It's, uh-

BERT TROLL
Tell us the secret!

BILBO
Ye-yes, I'm telling you. The secret is- to skin them first!

BERT TROLL
Tom, get me filleting knife.

WILLIAM TROLL
What a load of rubbish! I've eaten plenty with their skins on. Scoff 'em I say, boots and all!

TOM TROLL
He's right! Nothing wrong with a bit o' raw dwarf.

TOM TROLL
Nice and crunchy.

BILBO
Not- not that one, he's infected!

WILLIAM TROLL
You what?

BILBO
Yeah he's got worms in his tubes.

TOM TROLL
Ooh!

BILBO
In-in fact, they all have. They're infested with parasites, it's a terrible business, I wouldn't risk it, I really wouldn't.

OIN
Parasites? Did he say parasites?

KILI
Yeah, we don't have parasites!

KILI
You have parasites!

OIN
I've got parasites as big as my arm!

KILI
Mine are the biggest parasites, I've got huge parasites!

NORI
We're riddled!

ORI
Yes, I'm riddled!

DORI
Yes, we are, badly!

WILLIAM TROLL
What would you have us do then? Let 'em all go?

BILBO
Well-

WILLIAM TROLL
You think I don't know what you're up to. This little ferret is taking us for fools!

BILBO
Ferret?

BERT TROLL
Fools?

GANDALF
The dawn will take you all!

WILLIAM TROLL
Who's that?

BERT TROLL
No idea.

TOM TROLL
Can we eat him too?

DWALIN
Ooh, get your foot out of my back!

THORIN
Where did you go to, if I may ask?

GANDALF
To look ahead.

THORIN
What brought you back?

GANDALF
Looking behind. Nasty business. Still they all are in one piece.

THORIN
No thanks to your burglar.

GANDALF
He had the nous to play for time. None of the rest of you thought of that.

GANDALF
They must have come down from the Ettenmoors.

THORIN
Since when the mountain trolls venture this far south?

GANDALF
Oh, not for an age. Not since a darker power ruled these lands.

GANDALF
They could not have moved in daylight.

THORIN
There must be a cave nearby.

STOP

BOFUR
Oh, what's that stench?

GANDALF
It's a troll hoard. Be careful what you touch.

BOFUR
Seems a shame just to leave it lying around. Anyone could take it.

GLOIN
Agreed. Nori, get a shovel.

THORIN
These swords were not made by any troll.

GANDALF
Nor were they made by any smith among men.

GANDALF
These were forged in Gondolin, by the High Elves, of the First Age. You could not wish for a finer blade.

GLOIN
We're making a long-term deposit.

THORIN
Let's get out of this foul place. Come on, let's go. Bofur, Gloin, Nori.

GANDALF
Bilbo.

BILBO
Hm?

GANDALF
Here. This is about your size.

BILBO
I can't take this.

GANDALF
The blade is of Elvish make, which means it will glow blue when orcs or goblins are nearby.

BILBO
I have never used a sword in my life.

GANDALF
And I hope you never have to. But if you do, remember this
true courage is about knowing not when to take a life, but when to spare one.

STOP

THORIN
Something's coming!

BILBO
Gandalf.

GANDALF
Stay together! Hurry, now! Arm yourselves!

RADAGAST
Thieves! Fire! Murder!

GANDALF
Radagast. It's Radagast the Brown!

GANDALF
What on earth are you doing here?

RADAGAST
I was looking for you, Gandalf. Something's wrong. Something's terribly wrong.

GANDALF
Yes?

RADAGAST
Just give me a minute - oh! I had a thought and now I've lost it.
It was right there, on the tip of my tongue! Oh! It's not a thought at all! It's a silly old stick insect.

RADAGAST
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf. A darkness has fallen over it, nothing grows anymore.
At least nothing good. The air is foul decay, but worse are the webs.

GANDALF
Webs? What do you mean?

RADAGAST
Spiders, Gandalf. Giant ones. Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant,
or I'm not a wizard. I followed their trail. They came from Dol Guldur.

GANDALF
Dol Guldur? But the old fortress is abandoned.

RADAGAST
No, Gandalf. It is not.

RADAGAST
A dark power dwells in there, such as I have never felt before.
It is the shadow of an ancient horror. One that can summon the spirits of the dead.

RADAGAST
I saw him, Gandalf. From out of the darkness, the Necromancer has come!

RADAGAST
Sorry.

GANDALF
Try a little old Toby. It'll help setting your nerves.

GANDALF
And out.

GANDALF
Now, the Necromancer. Are you sure?

RADAGAST
That is not from the world of the living.

BILBO
Was that a wolf? Are there wolves out there?

BOFUR
Wolves? No, that is not a wolf.

THORIN
Warg scouts! Which means an orc pack is not far behind!

BILBO
Orc pack?

GANDALF
Who did you tell about your quest, beyond your kin?

THORIN
No one.

GANDALF
Who did you tell?

THORIN
No one, I swear! What in Durin's name is going on?

GANDALF
You are being hunted.

DWALIN
We have to get out of here.

ORI
We can't! We have no ponies. They bolted.

RADAGAST
I'll draw them off.

GANDALF
These are Gundabad wargs. They will outrun you!

RADAGAST
These are Rhosgobel rabbits. I'd like to see them try.

RADAGAST
Come and get me!

GANDALF
Come on!

GANDALF
Stay together.

THORIN
Move!

THORIN
Ori, no! Come back.

GANDALF
All of you, come on, come on! Quick!

THORIN
Where are you leading us?

HUNTER ORC
The Dwarf-scum are over there! After them!

GANDALF
Move! Run!

GLOIN
There they are!

GANDALF
This way! Quickly!

KILI
There's more coming!

THORIN
Ki­li! Shoot them!

FILI
We're surrounded!

FILI
Where's Gandalf?

DWALIN
He's abandoned us!

THORIN
Hold your ground!

GANDALF
This way, you fools!

THORIN
Come on, move! Quickly! All of you!

THORIN
Go, go, go!

GANDALF
nine, ten-

THORIN
Kili! Run!

THORIN
Elves.

DWALIN
I cannot see where the pathway leads. Do we follow it or not?

BOFUR
We follow it, of course!

GANDALF
I think that would be wise.

STOP

GANDALF
The Valley of Imladris. In the common tongue, it's known by another name.

BILBO
Rivendell.

GANDALF
Here lies the last homely house, east of the sea.

THORIN
This was your plan all along, to seek refuge with our enemy.

GANDALF
You have no enemies here, Thorin Oakenshield. The only ill-will to be found in this valley is that which you bring yourself.

THORIN
You think the Elves will give our quest their blessing? They will try to stop us.

GANDALF
Of course, they will. But we have questions that need to be answered.
If we are to be successful this will need to be handled with tact, and respect,
and no small degree of charm, which is why you will leave the talking to me.

LINDIR
Mithrandir.

GANDALF
Ah, Lindir.

THORIN
Stay sharp.

LINDIR
We heard you had crossed into the Valley.

GANDALF
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

LINDIR
My Lord Elrond is not here.

GANDALF
Not here? Where is he?

THORIN
Close ranks!

ELROND
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Lord Elrond.

GANDALF
My friend! Where have you been?

ELROND
We've been hunting a pack of Orcs that came up from the South. We slew a number near the Hidden Pass.

ELROND
Strange for orcs to come so close to our borders. Something or someone has drawn them near.

GANDALF
Ah, that may have been us.

ELROND
Welcome Thorin, son of Thrain.

THORIN
I do not believe we have met.

ELROND
You have your Grandfather's bearing. I knew Thror when he ruled under the mountain.

THORIN
Indeed? He made no mention of you.

GLOIN
What is he saying? Does he offer us insult?

GANDALF
No, Master Gloin, he's offering you food.

GLOIN
Ah, Well. In that case, lead on.

STOP

DORI
Try it. Just a mouthful.

ORI
I don't like green food.

DWALIN
Where's the meat?

ORI
Have they got any chips?

GANDALF
Kind of you to invite us. I'm not really dressed for dinner.

ELROND
Well, you never are.

STOP

ELROND
This is Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver. A famous blade, forged by the High Elves of the West. My kin.

ELROND
May it serve you well.

ELROND
And this is Glamdring. The Foe-hammer, sword of the King of Gondolin. These swords were made for the Goblin wars of the First Age.

BALIN
I wouldn't bother, laddie. Swords are named for their great deeds they do in war.

BILBO
What are you saying, my sword hasn't seen battles?

BALIN
I'm not actually sure it is a sword. More of a letter opener, really.

ELROND
How did you come by these?

GANDALF
We found them in a troll hoard on the Great East road, shortly before we were ambushed by orcs.

ELROND
And what were you doing on the Great East road?

THORIN
Our business is no concern of Elves.

GANDALF
For goodness sake. Thorin, show him the map!

THORIN
It is the legacy of my people. It's mine to protect! As are its secrets.

GANDALF
Save me from the stubbornness of dwarves. Your pride will be your downfall.
You stand here in the presence of one of the few in Middle-earth who can read that map. Show it to Lord Elrond!

BALIN
Thorin, no!

ELROND
Erebor. What is your interest in this map?

GANDALF
It's mainly academic. As you know, this sort of artifacts sometimes contains hidden text.

GANDALF
You still read ancient dwarvish, do you not?

ELROND
‘Cirth ithil'.

GANDALF
Moon runes. Of course. An easy thing to miss.

ELROND
Well in this case, that is true.
Moon runes can only be read by the light of the moon of the same shape and season as the day on which they were written.

THORIN
Can you read them?

ELROND
These runes were written on a mid-summer's eve by the light of a crescent moon nearly two hundred years ago.
It would seem you were meant to come to Rivendell.
Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield. The same moon shines upon us tonight.

ELROND
‘Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks, and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.'

BILBO
Durin's Day?

GANDALF
It is the start of the dwarves new year, when the last moon of Autumn and the first sun of Winter appear in the sky together.

THORIN
This is ill news. Summer is passing, Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

BALIN
We still have time.

BILBO
Time, for what?

BALIN
To find the entrance. We have to be standing at exactly the right spot, at exactly the right time.
Then, and only then, can the door be opened.

ELROND
So this is your purpose, to enter the mountain.

THORIN
What of it?

ELROND
There are some who would not deem it wise.

GANDALF
Who do you mean?

ELROND
You are not the only guardian to stand watch over Middle-earth.

STOP

HUNTER ORC
The Dwarves, Master, we lost them. Ambushed by Elvish filth, we were-

AZOG
I don't want excuses. I want the head of the Dwarf King!

HUNTER ORC
We were outnumbered, there was nothing we could do. I barely escaped with my life.

AZOG
Far better you had paid with it.

AZOG
The Dwarf-scum will show themselves soon enough.

AZOG
Send out word, there is a price on their heads!

STOP

GANDALF
With or without our help, these dwarves will march on the mountain. They're determined to reclaim their homeland. I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield feels that he's answerable to anyone. Nor for that matter am I.

ELROND
But it's not me you must answer to.

GANDALF
Lady Galadriel.

GALADRIEL
Mithrandir.

GANDALF
It has been a long time.

GALADRIEL
Age may have changed me, but not so the lady of Lorien.

GALADRIEL
I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you.

SARUMAN
He didn't. I did.

GALADRIEL
Saruman.

SARUMAN
You've been busy of late, my friend.

SARUMAN
Tell me, Gandalf, did you think these plans and schemes of yours would go unnoticed?

GANDALF
Unnoticed? No, I'm simply doing what I feel to be right.

GALADRIEL
The dragon has long been on your mind.

GANDALF
It is true, my Lady. Smaug owes allegiance to no one. But if he should side with the enemy, the dragon could be used to terrible effect.

SARUMAN
What enemy? Gandalf, the enemy is defeated. Sauron is vanquished. He can never regain his full strength.

ELROND
Gandalf, for four hundred years we have lived in peace. A hard won watchful peace.

GANDALF
Are we? Are we at peace? Trolls have come down from the mountains, they are raiding villages, destroying farms. Orcs have attacked us on the road.

ELROND
Hardly a prelude to war.

SARUMAN
Always you must meddle. Looking for trouble where none exists!

GALADRIEL
Let him speak.

GANDALF
There is something at work beyond the evil of Smaug, something far more powerful.
We can remain blind to it, but it will not be ignoring us, that I can promise you.
A sickness hides over the Greenwood. The woodsmen who live there now call it Mirkwood, and they say-

SARUMAN
Well, don't stop now, tell us what the woodsmen say?

GANDALF
They speak of a Necromancer, living in Dol Guldur, a sorcerer who can summon the dead.

SARUMAN
That's absurd. No such power exists in this world.
This Necromancer is nothing more than a mortal man. A conjurer dabbling in black magic.

GANDALF
And so I though too. But Radagast has seen-

SARUMAN
Radagast? Do not speak to me of Radagast the Brown. He's a foolish fellow.

GANDALF
Well, he's odd, I grant you. He lives a solitary life.

SARUMAN
It's not that. It's his excessive consumption of mushrooms. They've addled his brain,
and yellowed his teeth. I warned him. It is unbefitting one of the Istari wandering the wood.

GALADRIEL
You carry something. It came to you from Radagast, he found it in Dol Guldur.

GANDALF
Yes.

GALADRIEL
Show me.

ELROND
What is that?

GALADRIEL
A relic of Mordor.

ELROND
A Morgul blade.

GALADRIEL
Made for the witch-king of Angmar, and buried with him. When Angmar fell, the men of the North took his body,
and all that he possessed and sealed it within the high fells of Rhudaur. Deep within the rock they buried him,
in a tomb so dark it would never come to light.

ELROND
This is not possible. A powerful spell lies upon those tombs, they cannot be opened.

SARUMAN
What proof do we have this weapon came from Angmar's grave?

GANDALF
I have none.

SARUMAN
Because there is none. Let us examine what we know. A single orc pack has dared to cross the Bruinen.
A dagger from a by-gone age has been found. And a human sorcerer who calls himself the Necromancer,
has taken up residence in a ruined fortress. It's not so very much, after all.
The question of this dwarvish company however, troubles me deeply. I'm not convinced, Gandalf.
I do not feel I can condone such a quest. If they'd come to me, I might have spare them this disappointment.
I will not pretend to understand your reasons for raising their hopes.

GALADRIEL
They are leaving.

GANDALF
Yes.

GALADRIEL
You knew.

SARUMAN
- I'm afraid there's nothing else for it.

LINDIR
My Lord Elrond. The dwarves, they've gone.

STOP

THORIN
Be on your guard, we're about to step over the Edge of the Wild. Balin, you know these paths, lead on.

BALIN
Aye.

THORIN
Master Baggins, I suggest you keep up.

STOP

GALADRIEL
You will follow them.

GANDALF
Yes.

GALADRIEL
You are right to help Thorin Oakenshield. But I fear this quest has set in motion forces we do not yet understand.
The riddle of the Morgul blade must be answered. Something moves in the shadows, unseen, hidden from our side,
it will not show itself, not yet. But every day it grows in strength. You must be careful.

GANDALF
Yes.

GALADRIEL
Mithrandir.

GALADRIEL
Why the Halfling?

GANDALF
I do not know. Saruman believes that it is only a great power that can hold evil in check,
but that is not what I have found. I've found it is the small things, everyday deeds of ordinary folk,
that keep the darkness at bay. Simple acts of kindness and love. Why Bilbo Baggins?
Perhaps it is because I'm afraid and he gives me courage.

GALADRIEL
Do not be afraid, Mithrandir. You are not alone.

GALADRIEL
If you should ever need my help, I will come.

STOP

THORIN
Alright, hold on!

THORIN
We must find shelter!

DWALIN
Look out!

BIFUR
Hold on!

BALIN
This is no thunderstorms! It's a thunder-battle! Look!

BOFUR
Well bless me. The legends are true! Giants! Stone giants!

THORIN
Take cover, you fool!

NORI
Hold on!

FILI
Ki­li, grab my hand!

BALIN
We're alright! We're alive!

BOFUR
Where's Bilbo? Where's the hobbit?

THORIN
Get him!

BOFUR
Grab my hand! Bilbo! Come on and take it!

DWALIN
I thought we'd lost our burglar.

THORIN
He's been lost ever since he left home. He should never have come. He has no place amongst us.

THORIN
Dwalin!

DWALIN
It looks safe enough.

THORIN
Search to the back, caves in the mountains are seldom unoccupied.

DWALIN
There's nothing here.

GLOIN
Right then, let's get a fire started.

THORIN
No. No fires. Not in this place. Get some sleep, we start at first light.

BALIN
We were to wait in the mountains until Gandalf joined us. That was the plan.

THORIN
Plans change. Bofur, take the first watch.

AZOG
The scent is fresh! They have taken the mountain pass.

STOP

BOFUR
Where do you think you're going?

BILBO
Back to Rivendell.

BOFUR
No. No. No. You can't turn back, now. You're part of the company. You're one of us.

BILBO
I'm not though, am I? Thorin said I should never have come, and he was right.
I'm not a Took, I'm a Baggins, I don't know what I was thinking. I should've never run out the door.

BOFUR
You're homesick, I understand.

BILBO
No, you don't! You don't understand, none of you do, you're dwarves! You're used to this life,
to living on the road, never settling in one place, not belonging anywhere!

BILBO
I'm sorry. I didn't-

BOFUR
No, you're right. We don't belong anywhere.

BOFUR
I wish you all the luck in the world. I really do.

BOFUR
What's that?

THORIN
Wake up. Wake up!

STOP

GREAT GOBLIN
Who would be so bold as to come armed into my kingdom? Spies? Thieves? Assassins?

GOBLIN
Dwarves, your Malevolence.

GREAT GOBLIN
Dwarves?

GOBLIN
We found them on the front porch.

GREAT GOBLIN
Well don't just stand there, search them! Every crack, every crevice!

GREAT GOBLIN
What are you doing in these parts? Speak!

GREAT GOBLIN
Very well, if they will not talk, we'll make them squawk!
Bring up the mangler, bring up the bone breaker! Start with the youngest.

THORIN
Wait!

GREAT GOBLIN
Well, well, well! Look who it is! Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror, king under the mountain.

GREAT GOBLIN
Oh! But I'm forgetting you don't have mountain, and you're not a king. Which makes you nobody really.
I know someone who would pay a pretty price for your head. Just the head, nothing attached.
Perhaps you know of whom I speak, an old enemy of yours. A pale orc astride a white warg.

THORIN
Azog the Defiler was destroyed. He was slain in battle long ago

GREAT GOBLIN
So you think his defiling days are done, do you?

GREAT GOBLIN
Send word to the pale orc, tell him I have found his prize.

STOP

GOLLUM
Yesss. Yes! Yes. Gollum. Yes! Gollum! Gollum!

GOLLUM
Nasty goblinses are better than old bones, precious. Better than nothing.

GOLLUM
Aah, too many boneses, precious! Not enough flesh. Shut up! Cut its skin off! Start with its head.

GOLLUM
The cold hard lands, they bites our hands, they gnaws our feet,
for rocks and stones are like old bones all bare of meat, cold as death, without no breath it's good to eat.

GOLLUM
Bless us and splash us, precious. That's a meaty mouthful.

GOLLUM
Gollum, Gollum!

BILBO
Back. Stay back. I'm warning you, don't come any closer.

GOLLUM
It's got an Elfish blade, but it's not an Elfes. Not an Elfes, no. What is it, precious? What is it?

BILBO
My name is Bilbo Baggins.

GOLLUM
Bagginses. What is a Bagginses, precious?

BILBO
I'm a- hobbit from the Shire.

GOLLUM
Oh! We like goblinses, batses and fishes, but we hasn't tried Hobbitses before! Is it soft? Is it juicy?

BILBO
Now! Now, k-keep your distance!

BILBO
I'll use this, if I have too.

BILBO
I don't - want any trouble, you understand? Just show me the way to get out of here, and I'll be on my way.

GOLLUM
Why? Is it lost?

BILBO
Yes. Yes, and I want to get unlost, as soon as possible.

GOLLUM
Oh, we knows! We knows safe path for hobbitses. Safe path in the dark. Shut up!

BILBO
I didn't say anything.

GOLLUM
I wasn't talking to you!

GOLLUM
Oh yes, we was, precious, we was.

BILBO
Look, I don't know what your game is, but I-

GOLLUM
Games? Oh, we love games, doesn't we, precious? Does it like games? Does it, does it, does it like to play?

BILBO
Maybe.

GOLLUM
What has roots as nobody sees, is taller than trees, up, up, up it goes, and yet never grows?

BILBO
The mountain.

GOLLUM
Yes! Yes! Ooh, let's have another one, huh? Yes. Go, do it again. Do it, do it again, ask us.

GOLLUM
No! No more riddles. Finish him off, finish him now! Gollum, Gollum!

BILBO
No! No, no, no. I want to play. I do. I want to play. I can see you are very good at this.
So why don't we have a game of riddles? Yes, just- just you and me.

GOLLUM
Yes. Just us.

BILBO
Yes, yes! And if I win, you will show me the way out. Yes?

GOLLUM
Yes. Yes!

GOLLUM
And if it loses, what then? Well, if it loses, precious, then we eats it!

GOLLUM
If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.

BILBO
Fair enough.

GOLLUM
The Baggins first.

BILBO
Thirty white horses on a red hill. First they champ, then they stamp, then they stand still.

GOLLUM
Teeth?

GOLLUM
Teeth!

GOLLUM
Yes, my precious! But we only have nine.

GOLLUM
Our turn. Voiceless it cries, wingless flutters, toothless bites, mouthless mutters.

BILBO
Just a minute.

GOLLUM
Ooh! We knows, we knows!

GOLLUM
Shut up!

BILBO
Wind.

BILBO
It's wind! Of course it is.

GOLLUM
Very clever, hobbitses. Very clever!

BILBO
A box without hinges, key or lid, yet golden treasure inside is hid.

BILBO
Well?

GOLLUM
It's nasty.

BILBO
Give up?

GOLLUM
Give us a chance, precious! Give us a chance!

GOLLUM
Eggses! Eggses! Wet, crunchy little eggses, yes. Grandmother taught us to suck them, yes!

GOLLUM
We have one for you. All things it devours; birds, beasts, trees, flowers.
Gnaws iron, bites steel, Grinds hard stones to meal. Answer us.

BILBO
Give me a moment, please. I gave you a good long while.

BILBO
I don't know this one.

GOLLUM
Is it tasty? Is it scrumptious? Is it crunchable!

BILBO
Let me think! Let me think.

GOLLUM
It's stuck. Bagginses is stuck. Time's up.

BILBO
Time? Ti- The answer is Time.

BILBO
Actually, it wasn't that hard.

GOLLUM
Last question. Last chance.

BILBO
Okay. Uh-

GOLLUM
Ask us. Ask us!

BILBO
Yes. Yes, alright.

BILBO
What have I got in my pocket?

GOLLUM
Well, that's no fair. It's no fair! It's against the rules!

GOLLUM
You ask us another one.

BILBO
No. No, no, no. You said, ask me a question. Well that is my question. What have I got in my pocket?

GOLLUM
Three guesses, precious. He must give us three!

BILBO
Three guesses, very well, guess away.

GOLLUM
Handses!

Wrong. Guess again.

Uuh! Fish bones, goblin's teeth, wet shells, bat's wings! Oooh! Aaah!

GOLLUM
Knife!

GOLLUM

BILBO
Wrong, again. Last guess.

GOLLUM
String! Or nothing.

BILBO
Two guesses at once. Wrong both times.

BILBO
So. Come then. I won the game, you promised to show me the way out.

GOLLUM
Did we say so, precious? Did we say so?

GOLLUM
What has it got in its pocketses?

BILBO
That's no concern of yours. You lost.

GOLLUM
Lost. Lost? Lost?

GOLLUM
Where is it? Where is it?

GOLLUM
No! Aaah! Where is it? Nooo! Lost, lost! Curse us and splash us, my precious is lost!

BILBO

GOLLUM
Mustn't ask us! Not its business! Nooo! Gollum! Gollum!

GOLLUM
What has it got in its nasty little pocketses?

GOLLUM
He stole it. He stole it! Aaah! He stole it!

STOP

GREAT GOBLIN
Bones will be shattered, necks will be wrung, and you'll be beaten and battered, from racks you'll be hung.
You will die down here and never be found, down in the deep of Goblin town.

GREAT GOBLIN
I know that sword! It is the Goblin-cleaver! The Biter! The blade that sliced a thousand necks!

GREAT GOBLIN
Slash them, beat them, peel them, kill them all!

GREAT GOBLIN
Cut off his head!

GANDALF
Take up arms. Fight. Fight!

GREAT GOBLIN
He wields the Foe-hammer, the beater, bright as daylight!

GANDALF
Follow me. Quick! Run!

STOP

GOLLUM
Give it to us!

GOLLUM
It's ours. It's ours!

GOLLUM
Thief! Baggins!

STOP

GREAT GOBLIN
You thought you could escape me!

GREAT GOBLIN
What are you going to do now, wizard?

GREAT GOBLIN
*stertorous* That'll do it.

STOP

BOFUR
Well, that could have been worse.

DWALIN
You've got to be joking!

KILI
Gandalf!

DWALIN
There's too many, we can't fight them.

GANDALF
Only one thing will save us. Daylight! Come on!

GANDALF
Here, on your feet.

STOP

GOLLUM
Wait, my precious. Wait! Gollum! Gollum!

GOLLUM
Baggins! Thief! Curse it and crush it, we hates it forever!

STOP

GANDALF
Five, six, seven, eight. Bifur, Bofur, that's ten. Fili, Ki­li, that's twelve.
And Bombur, that makes thirteen. Where's Bilbo? Where is our hobbit? Where is our hobbit?

GLOIN
Curse that Halfling! Now he's lost! I thought he was with Dori!

DORI
Don't blame me!

GANDALF
And where did you last see him?

BIFUR
I think I saw him slip away when they first collared us.

GANDALF
What happened exactly? Tell me!

THORIN
I'll tell you what happened. Master Baggins saw his chance and he took it!
He's thought of nothing but his soft bed and his warm hearth since first he stepped out of his door.
We will not be seeing our hobbit again, he is long gone.

BILBO
No, he isn't.

GANDALF
Bilbo Baggins. I've never been so glad to see anyone in my life.

KILI
Bilbo, we'd given you up!

FILI
How on earth did you get past the goblins?

DWALIN
How indeed?

GANDALF
Oh, what does it matter? He's back.

THORIN
It matters. I want to know. Why did you come back?

BILBO
Look, I know you doubt me. I know you always have. And you're right, I often think of Bag End.
I miss my books, and my arm chair, and my garden. See, that's where I belong. That's home.
And that's why I came back, cause- you don't have one. A home. It was taken from you, but I will help you take it back if I can.

STOP

AZOG
Run them down! Tear them to pieces!

THORIN
Out of the frying pan.

GANDALF
And into the fire. Run. Run!

GANDALF
Up into the trees. All of you! Come on, climb! Bilbo, climb!

THORIN
They're coming!

THORIN
Azog!

AZOG
Do you smell it? The scent of fear? I remember your father reeked of it, Thorin son of Thrain.

THORIN
It cannot be.

AZOG
That one is mine. Kill the others!

AZOG
Drink their blood!

GANDALF
Fili!

DORI
Mister Gandalf! Aah!

AZOG
Bring me the Dwarf's head.

AZOG
Kill him.

GANDALF
Thorin! Thorin.

STOP

THORIN
The Halfling?

GANDALF
It's alright. Bilbo is here, he's quite safe.

THORIN
You! What were you doing? You nearly got yourself killed! Did I not say that you would be a burden?
That you would not survive in the wild, and you had no place amongst us?

THORIN
I have never been so wrong, in all my life.

THORIN
But, I'm sorry I doubted you.

BILBO
No, I would have doubted me too. I'm not a hero, nor a warrior. Not even a burglar.

BILBO
Is that what I think it is?

GANDALF
Erebor! The Lonely Mountain. The last of the Great Dwarf Kingdoms of Middle-earth.

THORIN
Our home.

OIN
A raven! The birds are returning to the mountain.

GANDALF
That, my dear Oin, is a thrush.

THORIN
Well we'll take it as a sign, a good omen.

BILBO
You're right. I do believe the worst is behind us.
