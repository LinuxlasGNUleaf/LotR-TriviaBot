SAM
What is it, Mr Frodo?

FRODO
Nothing. Just a dream.

SAM
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don’t want to see any closer, and
the one place we’re trying to get to.
It’s just where we can’t get. Let’s
face it, Mr Frodo, we’re lost. I don’t
think Gandalf meant for us to come this
way.

FRODO
He didn’t mean for a lot of things to
happen, Sam, but they did.

SAM
Mr Frodo? It’s the Ring, isn’t it?

FRODO
It’s getting heavier.

FRODO
What food have we got left?

SAM
Well, let me see. Oh yes, lovely! Lembas bread.
And look! More lembas bread.

SAM
I don't usually hold with foreign food,
but this Elvish stuff, it’s not bad.

FRODO
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?

SAM
Those rain clouds might.

SAM
This looks strangely familiar.

FRODO
It’s because we’ve been here before!
We’re going in circles.

SAM
Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant
there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you
smell it?

FRODO
Yes. I can smell it. We’re not alone.

STOP

GOLLUM
The thieves! The thieves! The filthy
little thieves! Where is it? Where isss
it? They stole it from us. My preciousss.
Curse them! We hates them!
It’s ours, it is! And we wantssss it!

FRODO
This is Sting. You’ve seen it before, haven’t you, Gollum!
Release him or I’ll cut your throat!

STOP

GOLLUM
It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty
Elves twisted it. Take it off us!

SAM
Quiet you!

SAM
It’s hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor’s
going to hear this racket! Let’s just
tie him up and leave him.

GOLLUM
No! That would kill us! Kill us!

SAM
It’s no more than you deserve!

FRODO
Maybe he does deserve to die, but now
that I see him, I do pity him.

GOLLUM
We be nice to them if they
be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears
to do what you wants. We swears.

FRODO
There’s no promise you can make that
I can trust.

GOLLUM
We swears to serve the master of the
preciousss. We swears on - on the precious.
*Gollum, Gollum*

FRODO
The Ring is treacherous. It will hold
you to your word.

GOLLUM
Yes, on the preciousss. On the preciousss.

SAM
I don’t believe you!
Get down! I said, down!

FRODO
Sam!

SAM
He’s trying to trick us! We let him
go he’ll throttle us in our sleep!

FRODO
You know the way to Mordor?

GOLLUM
Yes.

FRODO
You’ve been there before?

GOLLUM
Yes.

FRODO
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

STOP

PIPPIN
Merry. Merry!

UGLÚK
What is it? What do you smell?

MAN-FLESH URUK
Man-flesh.

PIPPIN
Aragorn!

UGLÚK
They've picked up our trail! Let's move!

ARAGORN
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent. Hurry!

LEGOLAS
Come on, Gimli!

GIMLI
Three days’ and nights’ pursuit. No food.
No rest. And no sign of our quarry but
what bare rock can tell.

ARAGORN
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

LEGOLAS
They may yet be alive.

ARAGORN
Less than a day ahead of us. Come!

LEGOLAS
Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!

GIMLI
I am wasted on cross-country!
We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very
dangerous over short distances!

ARAGORN
Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There
is something strange at work here. Some
evil gives speed to these creatures,
sets its will against us.

ARAGORN
Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?

LEGOLAS
The Uruks turn northeast. They’re taking
the hobbits to Isengard!

ARAGORN
Saruman.

STOP

SARUMAN
The world is changing. Who now
has the strength to stand against the
armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand
against the might of Sauron and Saruman
and the union of the two towers?

SARUMAN
Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule
this Middle-earth.

SARUMAN
The old world will burn in the fires
of industry. The forests will fall.
A new order will rise. We will drive
the machine of war with the sword and
the spear and the iron fists of the
Orc. We have only to remove those who
oppose us.

STOP

SARUMAN
The horsemen took your land. They drove
your people into the hills to scratch
a living off rocks.

DUNLAND MAN
Murderers!

SARUMAN
Take back the lands they stole from
you! Burn every village!

DUNLAND CROWD
Argh!

SARUMAN
It will begin in Rohan. Too long have
these peasants stood against you. But
no more.

STOP

MORWEN
Éothain! Éothain! You take your sister.
You’ll go faster with just two.

FREDA
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf,
he is too big for him!

MORWEN
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm. Do you understand
me?

ÉOTHAIN
Yes, Ma!

FREDA
I don’t wanna leave!
I don't wanna go, Mama!

MORWEN
Freda, I will find you there.

MORWEN
Quickly!

MORWEN
Go child!

SARUMAN
Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall.

STOP

EOWYN
Théodred!

EOWYN
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

EOMER
He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don’t
defend our country, Saruman will take
it by force.

GRIMA
That is a lie!
Saruman the White has ever been our
friend and ally.

THEODEN
Grima, Grima.
My son? Grima?

EOMER
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at
will. Orcs bearing the white hand of
Saruman.

GRIMA
Why do you lay these troubles on an
already troubled mind. Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent,
your war-mongering.

EOMER
War-mongering?

EOMER
How long is it since Saruman bought
you? What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the men are dead you will take
your share of the treasure?

EOMER
Too long have you watched my sister,
too long have you haunted her steps.

GRIMA
You see much Eomer, Son of Éomund. Too
much. You are banished forthwith from the
kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death!

EOMER
Argh!

STOP

GIMLI
Keep breathing! That’s the key! Breathe!
Ho!

LEGOLAS
They’ve run as if the very whips of
their masters were behind them.

STOP

MORDOR ORC
We’re not going no further till we’ve
had a breather!

UGLÚK
Get a fire going!

PIPPIN
Merry! Merry!

MERRY
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

PIPPIN
What’s making that noise?

MERRY
It’s the trees.

PIPPIN
What?

MERRY
Do you remember the Old Forest? On the
borders of Buckland? Folk used to say
that there was something in the water
that made the trees grow tall, and
come alive.

PIPPIN
Alive?

MERRY
Trees that could whisper. Talk to each
other. Even move.

MAÚHUR
I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' but
maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!

SNAGA
Yeah. Why can’t we have some meat?
What about them? They’re fresh.

UGLÚK
They are not for eating!

GRISHNÁKH
What about their legs? They don't need
those. Ooh! Hey look tasty!

UGLÚK
Get back, scum!

MORDOR ORC
Carve them up!

SNAGA
Just a mouth full.

UGLÚK
No!

UGLÚK
Looks like meat’s back on the menu,
boys!

MERRY
Pippin, let’s go.

GRISHNÁKH
Go on, call for help. Squeal!
No one’s gonna save you now!

MERRY
Pippin!

PIPPIN
ARGH!

STOP

LEGOLAS
A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night.

ARAGORN
Riders of Rohan, what news from the
Mark?

EOMER
What business does an Elf, a man and
a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak
quickly!

GIMLI
Give me your name, Horsemaster, and
I shall give you mine.

EOMER
I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if
it stood but a little higher from the
ground.

LEGOLAS
You would die before your stroke fell!

ARAGORN
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This
is Gimli, son of Glóin and Legolas of
the Woodland realm. We are friends of
Rohan and of Theoden, your king.

EOMER
Theoden no longer recognizes friend
from foe. Not even
his own kin.

EOMER
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the
king and claimed lordship over these
lands. My company are those loyal to
Rohan. And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning. He walks
here and there, they say, as an old
man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere
his spies slip past our nets.

ARAGORN
We are not spies. We track a party of
Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They’ve taken two of our friends captive.

EOMER
The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered
them during the night.

GIMLI
But there were two hobbits. Did you
see two hobbits with them?

ARAGORN
They would be small – only children
to your eyes.

EOMER
We left none alive. We piled the carcasses
and burned them.

GIMLI
Dead?

EOMER
I am sorry.

EOMER
Hasufel! Arod!
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters. Farewell.

EOMER
Look for your friends. But do not trust
to hope, it has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!

STOP

GIMLI
It’s one of their wee belts.

LEGOLAS
Hiro îth, ab 'wanath.
(May they find peace in death)

ARAGORN
AAARRGGHH! *breaks his toe*

GIMLI
We failed them.

ARAGORN
A hobbit lay here, and the other.
They crawled.

ARAGORN
Their hands were bound. Their bonds
were cut.

ARAGORN
They ran over here. They were followed.

ARAGORN
The tracks lead away from the battle!
Into Fangorn Forest.

GIMLI
Fangorn. What madness drove them in
there?

STOP

PIPPIN
Did we lose him? I think
we lost him.

GRISHNÁKH
I’m gonna rip out your filthy little
innards! Come here!

MERRY
Trees! Climb a tree!

MERRY
He's gone.

PIPPIN
Merry!

TREEBEARD
Hooooo.

PIPPIN
Argh!

GRISHNÁKH
Let’s put a maggot-hole in your belly.

PIPPIN
Run, Merry!

TREEBEARD
Little Orcs! Burárum!

PIPPIN
It’s talking, Merry. The tree is talking!

TREEBEARD
Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent.

MERRY
A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.

PIPPIN
Don’t talk to it, Merry. Don’t encourage
it.

TREEBEARD
Treebeard, some call me.

PIPPIN
And whose side are you on?

TREEBEARD
Side? I am on nobody’s side because
nobody’s on my side, little Orc. Nobody
cares for the woods anymore.

MERRY
We’re not Orcs. We’re Hobbits!

TREEBEARD
Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire, they come with
axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking,
burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse
them!

MERRY
No, you don’t understand. We’re Hobbits!
Halflings! Shirefolk!

TREEBEARD
Maybe you are and maybe you aren’t.
The White Wizard will know.

PIPPIN
The White Wizard?

MERRY
Saruman.

STOP

GOLLUM
See, see, we have led you out! Hurry
hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find
you.

SAM
Whoa, it’s a bog! He’s led us into a
swamp!

GOLLUM
A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We
will take you on safe paths through
the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go
quickly.

GOLLUM
I found it, I did. The way through the
marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't
know it. They go round for miles and
miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick
as shadows we must be.

SAM
There are dead things! Dead faces in
the water!

GOLLUM
All dead. All rotten. Elves and men
and orcses. A great battle long ago.
The Dead Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name.
This way. Don’t follow the lights.

SAM
Ohh!

GOLLUM
Careful now, or hobbits go down to join
the dead ones and light little candles
of their own.

STOP

SAM
Frodo!

FRODO
Gollum-

GOLLUM
Don’t follow the lights!

SAM
Mr Frodo! Are you alright?

STOP

GOLLUM
Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful. Our preciousss.

FRODO
What did you say?

GOLLUM
Master should be resting. Master needs
to keep up his strength.

FRODO
Who are you?

GOLLUM
Mustn’t ask us. Not its business. *Gollum,
Gollum*

FRODO
Gandalf told me you were one of the
River Folk.

GOLLUM
Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold
be travellers far from home.

FRODO
He said your life was a sad story.

GOLLUM
They do not see what lies ahead, when
sun has failed and moon is dead.

FRODO
You were not so very different from
a hobbit once, were you, Smeagol?

GOLLUM
What did you call me?

FRODO
That was your name once, wasn’t it?
A long time ago.

GOLLUM
My name. My name. S-Smeagol!

GOLLUM
Argh!

SAM
Black Riders!

GOLLUM
Hide! Hide!

FRODO
Argh!

SAM
C’mon Frodo! C'mon!

GOLLUM
Quick! They will see us! They will see
us!

SAM
I thought they were dead!

GOLLUM
Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.

GOLLUM
Wraiths! Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it. They are calling
for the preciousss.

SAM
Mr Frodo! It’s alright. I’m here.

GOLLUM
Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very
close.

STOP

GIMLI
*spits out* Orc blood.

ARAGORN
These are strange tracks.

GIMLI
The air is so close in here.

LEGOLAS
This forest is old. Very old. Full of
memory and anger.

LEGOLAS
The trees are speaking to each other.

ARAGORN
Gimli!
Lower your axe.

LEGOLAS
Aragorn, nad nâ ennas!
(Something is out there.)

ARAGORN
Man cenich?
(What do you see?)

LEGOLAS
The White Wizard approaches.

ARAGORN
Do not let him speak. He will put a
spell on us.

ARAGORN
We must be quick.

STOP

WHITE WIZARD
You are tracking the footsteps of two
young hobbits.

ARAGORN
Where are they?

WHITE WIZARD
They passed this way the day before
yesterday. They met someone they did
not expect. Does that comfort you?

ARAGORN
Who are you? Show yourself!

ARAGORN
It cannot be. You fell.

GANDALF
Through fire and water. From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak, I fought with the
Balrog of Morgoth.

GANDALF
Until at last, I threw down my enemy
and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.

GANDALF
Darkness took me. And I strayed out
of thought and time. Stars wheeled
overhead and everyday was as long as
a life-age of the earth. But it was
not the end. I felt life in me again.

GANDALF
I've been sent back until my task is
done.

ARAGORN
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Gandalf? Yes- That's what they used
to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was
my name.

GIMLI
Gandalf!

GANDALF
I am Gandalf
the White. And I come
back to you now at the turn of the tide.

STOP

GANDALF
One stage of your journey is over, another
begins. War has come to Rohan. We must
ride to Edoras with all speed.

LEGOLAS
That is one of the Mearas, unless my
eyes are cheated by some spell.

GANDALF
Shadowfax.
He's the lord of all horses and he's
been my friend through many dangers.

STOP

TREEBEARD
My home lies deep in the forest near
the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf
I would keep you safe and safe is where
I’ll keep you. The trees have grown
wild and dangerous. Anger festers in
their hearts. They will harm you if
they can. There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

STOP

GOLLUM
The Black Gate of Mordor.

SAM
Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing
or two to say if he could see us now.

GOLLUM
Master says to show him the way into
Mordor, so good Smeagol does. Master
says so.

FRODO
I did.

SAM
That’s it then. We cannot get past that.

SAM
Look! The gate, it's opening! I can
see a way down.

FRODO
Sam, no!

SAM
Argh!

GOLLUM
Master!

STOP

FRODO
I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.

SAM
I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these
Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.

FRODO
Now!

GOLLUM
No! No, no master! They catch you! They
catch you! Don’t take it to him! He
wants the preciousss. Always he’s looking
for it! And the preciousss is wanting
to go back to him. But we mustn’t let
him have it.

GOLLUM
No! There’s
another way. More secret. A dark way.

SAM
Why haven’t you spoken of this before?!

GOLLUM
Because Master did not ask!

SAM
He’s up to something.

FRODO
Are you saying there’s another way into
Mordor?

GOLLUM
Yes. There is a path, and some stairs,
and then, a tunnel.

FRODO
He’s led us this far, Sam.

SAM
Mr Frodo, no.

FRODO
He’s been true to his word.

SAM
No!

FRODO
Lead the way, Smeagol.

GOLLUM
Good Smeagol always helps.

STOP

GANDALF
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan,
whose mind is overthrown. Saruman’s
hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

EOWYN
My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord?
Uncle?

EOWYN
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?

GANDALF
Be careful what you say. Do not look
for welcome here.

GRIMA
Oh, he must have died sometime in
the night. What a tragedy for the king
to lose his only son and heir.

GRIMA
I understand his passing is hard to
accept, especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

EOWYN
Leave me alone, snake!

GRIMA
Oh, but you are alone! Who
knows what you have spoken to the darkness.
In bitter watches of the night, when
all your life seems to shrink, the walls
of your bower closing in about you,
like a hutch to trammel some wild thing
in.

GRIMA
So fair, so cold, like a morning of
pale spring still clinging to winter's
chill.

EOWYN
Your words are poison!

STOP

GIMLI
You’ll find more cheer in a graveyard.

HAMA
I cannot allow you before Theoden-King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order
of Grima Wormtongue.

HAMA
Your staff.

GANDALF
Hmm? Oh. You
would not part an old man from his walking
stick?

GRIMA
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He’s a herald of woe.

GANDALF
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat
lessened of late. Theoden King.

GRIMA
He’s not welcome.

THEODEN
Why should I welcome you - Gandalf Stormcrow?

GRIMA
A just question, my liege. Late is the hour in
which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news
is an ill guest.

GANDALF
Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind
you teeth. I have not passed through
fire and death to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm!

GRIMA
His staff! I told
you to take the wizard’s staff!

GANDALF
Theoden, son of Thengel, too long have
you sat in the shadows.

GIMLI
I would stay still, if I were
you.

GANDALF
Hearken to me! I release you from the
spell.

THEODEN
Hahahhhahahahah! You have
no power here, Gandalf the Grey!
Argh!

GANDALF
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison
is drawn from a wound.

THEODEN
If I go, Theoden dies.

GANDALF
You did not kill me, you will not kill
him!

THEODEN
Rohan is mine!

GANDALF
Be gone!

STOP

THEODEN
I know your face. Eowyn - Eowyn!

THEODEN
Gandalf?

GANDALF
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

THEODEN
Dark have been my dreams of late.

GANDALF
Your fingers would remember their old
strength better, if they grasped your
sword.

GRIMA
Argh! I've only ever served you, my lord!

THEODEN
Your leechcraft
would have had me crawling on all fours
like a beast!

GRIMA
Send me not from your side.

ARAGORN
No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilled on his
account.

GRIMA
Get out of my way!

HAMA
Hail, Theoden king!

THEODEN
Where is Théodred? Where is my son?

STOP

THEODEN
Simbelmynë. Ever has it grown on the
tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas, that these evil days should be
mine. The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days
of my house.

GANDALF
Théodred’s death was not of your making.

THEODEN
No parent should have to bury their
child.

GANDALF
He was strong in life. His spirit will
find its way to the halls of your fathers.
Westu hál. Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu. 
(Be-thou well. Go-thou, Théodred, go-thou.)

STOP

EOWYN
They had no warning. They were unarmed.
Now the wildmen are moving through the
Westfold, burning as they go. Rick,
cot and tree.

FREDA
Where’s mama?

EOWYN
Shh.

GANDALF
This is but a taste of the terror that
Saruman will unleash. All the more potent
for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on. Draw
him away from your women and children.
You must fight.

ARAGORN
You have two thousand good men riding
north as we speak. Eomer is loyal to
you. His men will return and fight for
their king.

THEODEN
They will be three hundred leagues from
here by now. Eomer cannot help us. I
know what it is that you want of me.
But I will not bring further death to
my people. I will not risk open war.

ARAGORN
Open war is upon you. Whether you would
risk it or not.

THEODEN
When last I looked, Theoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

GANDALF
Then what is the king’s decision?

STOP

HAMA
By order of the king, the city must
empty. We make for the refuge of Helm’s
Deep. Do not burden yourselves with
treasures. Take only what provisions
you need.

GIMLI
Helm’s Deep! They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight. Who
will defend them if not their king?

ARAGORN
He’s only doing what he thinks is best
for his people. Helm’s Deep has saved
them in the past.

GANDALF
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap. He thinks
he’s leading them to safety. What they
will get is a massacre. Theoden has
a strong will but I fear for him. I
fear for the survival of Rohan. He will
need you before the end, Aragorn. The
people of Rohan will need you. The defences
HAVE to hold.

ARAGORN
They will hold.

GANDALF
The Grey Pilgrim, that’s what they
used to call me. Three hundred lives
of men I’ve walked this earth and now
I have no time. With luck, my search
will not be in vain. Look to my coming
at first light on the fifth day. At
dawn, look to the East.

ARAGORN
Go.

STOP

ARAGORN
You have some skill with a blade.

EOWYN
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords may still die upon
them. I fear neither death nor pain.

ARAGORN
What do you fear, my lady?

EOWYN
A cage. To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them and all chance
of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.

ARAGORN
You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden
of Rohan. I
do not think that would be your fate.

STOP

GRIMA
Theoden will not stay at Edoras. It’s
vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect
an attack on the city. They will flee
to Helm’s Deep, the great fortress of
Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains. They will be
slow. They will have women and children
with them.

SARUMAN
Send out your warg riders.

STOP

SAM
Hey Stinker! Don’t go getting too far
ahead!

FRODO
Why do you do that?

SAM
What?

FRODO
Call him names; run him down all the
time.

SAM
Because - because that's what he is,
Mr Frodo. There's naught left in 'im
but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he
wants. It's all he cares about.

FRODO
You have no idea what
it did to him. What it’s still doing
to him.
I want to help him, Sam.

SAM
Why?

FRODO
Because I have to believe he can come
back.

SAM
You can’t save him, Mr Frodo.

FRODO
What do you know about
it? Nothing!

FRODO
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't
know why I said that.

SAM
I do. It's the Ring. You can't
take your eyes off it. I've seen you.
You're not eating. You barely sleep.
It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo.
You have to fight it!

FRODO
I know what I have
to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to
me! It's my task! Mine! My own!

SAM
Can’t you hear yourself? Don’t you know
who you sound like?

STOP

GOLLUM
We wants it. We needs it. Must have
the precioussss. They stole it from
us. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked,
trickssssy, falssse!

SMEAGOL
No! Not Master.

GOLLUM
Yes, precious. False. They will cheat
you, hurt you, lie.

SMEAGOL
Master’s my friend.

GOLLUM
You don’t have any friends.
Nobody likes YOU!

SMEAGOL
Not listening. I’m
not listening.

GOLLUM
You’re a liar and a thief.

SMEAGOL
Nope.

GOLLUM
Murderer!

SMEAGOL
Go away.

GOLLUM
Go away?
HAHAHAHA!

SMEAGOL
I hate you. I hate you!

GOLLUM
Where would you be without
me? *Gollum, Gollum*. I saved us. It
was me. We survived because of me!

SMEAGOL
Not anymore.

GOLLUM
What did you say?

SMEAGOL
Master looks after us now. We don’t
need you.

GOLLUM
What?

SMEAGOL
Leave now and never come back.

GOLLUM
No!

SMEAGOL
Leave now and never come back!

GOLLUM
Arrrgh!

SMEAGOL
LEAVE NOW AND NEVER COME BACK!

SMEAGOL
We- we told him to go away! And away
he goes, preciousss. Gone,
gone, gone! Smeagol is free!

STOP

SMEAGOL
Look! Look! See what Smeagol finds!
Hehehe! Hahaha!

SMEAGOL
They are young. They are tender. They
are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat
them!

SAM
You’ll make him sick, you will, behaving
like that!
There’s only one way to eat a brace
of coneys.

STOP

SMEAGOL
Argh! What’s it doing!
Stupid fat hobbit! It ruins it!

SAM
What’s to ruin? There’s hardly any meat
on ‘em.

SAM
What we need is a few good taters.

GOLLUM
What’s taters, preciousss? What’s taters
uh?

SAM
PO-TAY-TOES! Boil ‘em. Mash ‘em. Stick
‘em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

SMEAGOL
Pbbbttt!

SAM
Even you couldn’t say no to that.

SMEAGOL
Oh yes we could! Spoil nice fish!
Give it to usss rrraw - and wrrriggling!
You keep nasty chips.

SAM
You’re hopeless.

STOP

SAM
Who are they?

GOLLUM
Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They
are called to Mordor. The Dark One is
gathering all armies to him. It won’t
be long now. He will soon be ready.

SAM
Ready to do what?

GOLLUM
To make his war. The last war that will
cover all the world in shadow.

FRODO
We’ve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

SAM
Mr Frodo!
Look! It’s an Oliphaunt!

SAM
No one at home will believe this.

FRODO
Smeagol?

FRODO
We’ve lingered here too long. Come on,
Sam!

SAM
Ah!

FARAMIR
Bind their hands.

STOP

GIMLI
It’s true you don’t see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice
and appearance, *laughs* that they’re often
mistaken for Dwarf men!

ARAGORN
It’s the beards!

GIMLI
And this, in turn, has given rise to
the belief that there are no Dwarf women.
And that dwarves just spring out of
holes in the ground!

EOWYN
Hahahaha!

GIMLI
Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous!
Whoa!

EOWYN
Ooh!

GIMLI
It’s alright,
it’s alright. Nobody panic. That was
deliberate. It was deliberate.

STOP

ARWEN
The light of the Evenstar does not wax
and wane. It is mine to give to whom
I will, like my heart. Go to sleep.

ARAGORN
I am asleep. This is a dream.

ARWEN
Then it is a good dream. Sleep.

ARAGORN
Min lû pennich nin i aur hen telitha.
(You told me once that this day would
come.)

ARWEN
Ú i vethed - nâ i onnad.

is the beginning. You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.)

ARAGORN
Dolen i vâd o nin.
(My path is hidden from me.)

ARWEN
Si peliannen i vâd na dail lîn. Si boe

your feet. You cannot falter now.)

ARAGORN
Arwen.

ARWEN
Ae ú-esteliach nad, estelio han. Estelio

trust this. Trust us.)

STOP

ELROND
Our time here is ending. Arwen’s time
is ending. Let her go. Let her take
the ship into the west. Let her bear
away her love for you to the Undying
Lands. There it will be evergreen.

ARAGORN
But never more than a memory.

ELROND
I will not leave my daughter here to
die.

ARAGORN
She stays because she still has hope.

ELROND
She stays for YOU! She belongs with
her people!

ARAGORN
Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae o
auth a nîr a naeth. (You have a chance
for another life. Away from war - grief -
despair.)

ARWEN
Why are you saying this?

ARAGORN
I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was
a dream, Arwen, nothing more.

ARAGORN
This belongs to you.

ARWEN
It was a gift. Keep it.

STOP

EOWYN
Where is she? The woman who gave you
that jewel.

EOWYN
My lord?

ARAGORN
She is sailing to the Undying Lands,
with all that is left of her kin.

GAMLING
What is it? Hama?

HAMA
I’m not sure.

GAMLING
Wargs!

LEGOLAS
Argh! A scout!

THEODEN
What is it? What do you see?

ARAGORN
Wargs! We
are under attack!

ARAGORN
Get them out of here!

THEODEN
All riders to the head of the column!

GIMLI
Come on, get
me up here, I’m a rider!

THEODEN
You must lead the people
to Helm’s Deep. And make haste!

EOWYN
I can fight!

THEODEN
No! You must do this. For me.

THEODEN
Follow me! Yah!

GIMLI
Forward.
I mean, charge forward! March forward!
That’s it! Go on!

EOWYN
Make for the lower
ground! Stick together!

WARG-RIDERS
Argh!

THEODEN
CHARGE!

GIMLI
Bring your pretty face to my axe!

GIMLI
That one counts as mine!

GIMLI
Stinking creature. Argh!

STOP

GIMLI
Tell me
what happened and I will ease your passing.

SHARKU
He’s dead. Took
a little tumble off the cliff.

LEGOLAS
You lie!

THEODEN
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.

THEODEN
Come.

STOP

REFUGEES
Helm’s Deep! At last! There it is!

OLD WOMAN
We’re safe, my lady! Thank
you!

FREDA
Mama!

MORWEN
Éothain! Freda!

GAMLING
Make way for Theoden!
Make way for the king!

EOWYN
So few. So few of you
have returned.

THEODEN
Our people are safe. We
have paid for it with many lives.

GIMLI
My lady.

EOWYN
Lord Aragorn, where is he?

GIMLI
He fell.

STOP

THEODEN
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate, and set a watch on the
surround.

GAMLING
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

THEODEN
Get them into the caves. Saruman's
arm would have grown long indeed if
he thinks he can reach us here.

STOP

GRIMA
Helm’s Deep has one weakness. Its outer
wall is solid rock but for a small culvert
at its base which is little more than
a drain.

GRIMA
How? How can fire undo stone? What kind
of device could bring down the wall?

SARUMAN
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep
will fall.

GRIMA
Even if it is breached,
it would take a number beyond reckoning,
thousands to storm the keep.

SARUMAN
Tens of thousands.

GRIMA
But, my lord, there is no such force.

SARUMAN
A new power is rising. Its victory is
at hand!

SARUMAN
This night, the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms
Deep! Leave none alive!

SARUMAN
To war!

SARUMAN
There will be no dawn for Men.

STOP

PIPPIN
Look! There’s smoke to the south!

TREEBEARD
There is always smoke rising from Isengard
these days.

MERRY
Isengard?

TREEBEARD
There was a time when Saruman would
walk in my woods. But now he has a mind
of metal and wheels. He no longer cares
for growing things.

PIPPIN
What is it?

MERRY
It’s Saruman’s army! The war has started.

STOP

ARWEN
May the grace
of the Valar protect you.

ARAGORN
Brego-

STOP

ELROND
Arwen.

ELROND
Tollen i lû. I chair gwannar na Valannor.
Si bado, no círar. (Arwen, it is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go
now, before it is too late.)

ARWEN
I have made my choice.

ELROND
He is not coming back. Why do you linger
here when there is no hope?

ARWEN
There is still hope.

ELROND
If Aragorn survives this war, you will
still be parted. If Sauron is defeated,
and Aragorn made king and all that you
hope for comes true, you will still
have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay
of time, Aragorn will die.

ELROND
And there will be no comfort for you.
No comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death, an image of the
splendor of the kings of men in glory
undimmed before the breaking of the
world.

ELROND
But you, my daughter, you will linger
on in darkness and in doubt. As nightfall
in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell, bound to your grief,
under the fading trees, until all the
world is changed and the long years
of your life are utterly spent.

ELROND
Arwen. There is
nothing for you here, only death.

ELROND
A im, ú-'erin veleth lîn?
(Do I not also have your love?)

ARWEN
Gerich meleth nîn, ada.

GALADRIEL
I amar prestar aen. Han mathon ne

I feel it in the water, I feel it in
the earth, I smell it in the air.)

GALADRIEL
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy
the people of Rohan. Isengard has been unleashed.
The eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last
free kingdom of men.

GALADRIEL
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close. The strength
of the Ringbearer is failing. In his
heart, Frodo begins to understand. The quest will claim his
life. You know this. You have foreseen
it. It is the risk we all took.

GALADRIEL
In the gathering dark, the will of the
Ring grows strong. It works hard now
to find its way back into the hands
of men.

GALADRIEL
Men, who are so easily seduced by its
power. The young captain of Gondor has
but to extend his hands, take the Ring
for his own and the world will fall.
It is close now, so close to achieving
its goal.

GALADRIEL
For Sauron will have dominion of all
life on this Earth, even unto the ending
of the world. The time of the Elves
is over.

GALADRIEL
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?

STOP

FARAMIR
What news?

MADRIL
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked
Rohan. Theoden’s people have fled to
Helm’s Deep. But
we must look to our own borders. Faramir,
Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling
an army. Easterlings and Southrons are
passing through the Black Gate.

FARAMIR
How many?

MADRIL
Some thousands. More come every day.

FARAMIR
Who’s covering the river to the north?

MADRIL
We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but
if the city is attacked, we won’t hold
it.

FARAMIR
Saruman attacks
from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The
fight will come to men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us
soon. And he will strike hard. He knows
now we do not have the strength to repel
him.

FARAMIR
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

SAM
Spies?! Now wait just a minute!

FARAMIR
Well if you’re not spies, then who are
you?

FARAMIR
Speak.

FRODO
We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins
is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.

FARAMIR
Your bodyguard?

SAM
His gardener.

FARAMIR
And where is your skulking friend? That
gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured
look.

FRODO
There was no other.

FRODO
We set out from Rivendell with seven
companions. One we lost in Mória. Two
were my kin. A Dwarf there was also,
and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son
of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

FARAMIR
You’re a friend of Boromir?

FRODO
Yes - for my part.

FARAMIR
It will grieve you then to learn that
he is dead.

FRODO
Dead? How? When?

FARAMIR
As one of his companions, I’d hoped
you would tell me. He was my
brother.

GONDORIAN RANGER
Captain Faramir. We found
the third one.

FARAMIR
You must come with me. Now.

STOP

FARAMIR
Down there.

FARAMIR
To enter the forbidden pool bears the
penalty of death. They wait for
my command.

FARAMIR
Shall I shoot?

GOLLUM
The rock and pool is nice
and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish
to catch a fish , so juicy sweet!

FRODO
Wait! This creature
is bound to me. And I to him. He is
our guide. Please, let me go down to
him.

STOP

FRODO
Smeagol. Master is here. Come, Smeagol.
Trust master. Come!

GOLLUM
We must go now?

FRODO
Smeagol, you must trust master. Follow
me, come on. Come. Come, Smeagol. Nice
Smeagol. That’s it. Come on.

FRODO
Don’t hurt him! Smeagol don’t struggle!
Smeagol listen to me!

GOLLUM
Master!
No! No!

STOP

FARAMIR
Where are you leading them? Answer me!

GOLLUM
Sméa-gol. Why does it cry, Smeagol?

SMEAGOL
Cruel men hurts us. Master trickst us.

GOLLUM
Of course he did. I told you he was
tricksy. I told you he was false.

SMEAGOL
Master is our friend. Our friend!

GOLLUM
Master betrayed us.

SMEAGOL
No, not its business. Leave us alone!

GOLLUM
Filthy little hobbitses.
They stole it from us.

SMEAGOL
No. No!

FARAMIR
What did they steal?

GOLLUM
Myyy - PRECIOUSSS!
Aaaarrrggghhh!

STOP

SAM
We have to get out of here. You go.
Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring,
Mr Frodo. Just this once. Put it on.
Disappear.

FRODO
I can’t. You were right, Sam. You tried
to tell me, but - I’m sorry. The Ring’s
taking me Sam. If I put it on, he’ll
find me. He’ll see.

FARAMIR
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the wild I have you. Two halflings
and a host of men at my call. The Ring
of power within my grasp.

FARAMIR
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

FRODO
No!

SAM
Stop it! Leave him alone! Don’t you
understand? He’s got to destroy it.
That’s where we’re going. Into Mordor.
To the mountain of fire.

DAMROD
Osgiliath is under attack. They call
for reinforcements.

SAM
Please. It’s such a burden. Will you
not help him?

DAMROD
Captain?

FARAMIR
Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to
Gondor.

STOP

ARAGORN
Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.
(Well done, Brego, my friend)

REFUGEES
He’s alive!

GIMLI
Where is he? Where is he? Get out of
the way. I’m gonna kill him! You are the luckiest, the
canniest and the most reckless man I
ever knew! Bless
you, laddie!

ARAGORN
Gimli, where is the king?

LEGOLAS
Le ab-dollen. (You’re late.) You look terrible.

ARAGORN
Hannon le. (Thank you.)

THEODEN
A great host, you say?

ARAGORN
All Isengard is emptied

THEODEN
How many?

ARAGORN
Ten thousand strong at least.

THEODEN
Ten thousand?!

ARAGORN
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
to destroy the world of men. They will
be here by nightfall.

THEODEN
Let them come!

THEODEN
I want every man and strong
lad able to bear arms to be ready for
battle by nightfall.

THEODEN
We will cover the causeway and the gate
from above. No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall or set foot inside
the Hornburg.

GIMLI
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick
and their shields broad.

THEODEN
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.

THEODEN
They will break upon this fortress like
water on rock. Saruman’s hordes will
pillage and burn, we’ve seen it before.
Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt.
Within these walls, we will outlast
them.

ARAGORN
They do not come to destroy Rohan’s
crops or villages. They come to destroy
its people. Down to the last child.

THEODEN
What would
you have me do? Look at my men. Their
courage hangs by a thread. If this is
to be our end, then I would have them
make such an end as to be worthy of
remembrance.

ARAGORN
Send out riders, my lord. You must call
for aid.

THEODEN
And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We
are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.

ARAGORN
Gondor will answer.

THEODEN
Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold
fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies
closed in around us? Where was Gon –
No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone.
Get the women and children into the
caves.

GAMLING
We need more time to lay provisions
for a siege, lord –

THEODEN
There is no time. War is upon us!

ROHAN CAPTAIN
Secure the gate!

STOP

TREEBEARD
We Ents have not troubled about the
wars of men and wizards for a very long
time. But now something is about to
happen that has not happened for an
age: Ent Moot.

MERRY
What’s that?

TREEBEARD
'Tis a gathering.

MERRY
A gathering of what?

TREEBEARD
Beech, oak, chestnut, ash. Good, good,
good. Many have come. Now we must decide
if the Ents will go to war.

STOP

ARAGORN
Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These
are no soldiers.

GIMLI
Most have seen too many winters.

LEGOLAS
Or too few. Look at them. They’re frightened.
I can see it in their eyes. Boe a hûn: neled herain
dan caer menig! (And they should be.
Three hundred against ten thousand!)

ARAGORN
Si beriathar hýn. Amar nâ ned Edoras.
(They have more hope of defending themselves
here than at Edoras.)

LEGOLAS
Aragorn, men i ndagor. Hýn ú- ortheri.
Natha daged aen! (Aragorn, we are warriors.
They cannot win this fight. They are
all going to die!)

ARAGORN
Then I shall die as one them!

GIMLI
Let him go,
lad. Let him be.

STOP

GAMLING
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armory. My lord?

THEODEN
Who am I, Gamling?

GAMLING
You are our king, sire.

THEODEN
And do you trust your king?

GAMLING
Your men, my lord, will
follow you to whatever end.

THEODEN
To whatever end. Where is the horse
and the rider? Where is the horn that
was blowing? They have passed like rain
on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the west.
Behind the hills, into shadow. How did
it come to this?

STOP

ARAGORN
Give me your sword. What is your name?

HALETH
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord. The men
are saying that we will not live out
the night. They say that it is hopeless.

ARAGORN
This is a good sword, Haleth, son of
Hama.

ARAGORN
There is always hope.

STOP

LEGOLAS
We have trusted you this far. You have
not led us astray. Forgive me. I was
wrong to despair.

ARAGORN
Ú-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing
to forgive, Legolas.)

GIMLI
If we had more time I’d get this adjusted.
It’s a little tight across the chest.

LEGOLAS
That is no Orc horn.

BEREG
Send for the king.
Open the gate!

SOLDIER
Open the gate!

STOP

THEODEN
How is this possible?

HALDIR
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves
and men. Long ago we fought and died
together. We come to honor that allegiance.

ARAGORN
Mae govannen, Haldir.
(Welcome, Haldir)

ARAGORN
You are most welcome!

HALDIR
We are proud to
fight alongside men, once more.

STOP

GIMLI
You could have picked a better
spot.

GIMLI
Well lad, whatever luck you live by,
let’s hope it lasts the night.

LEGOLAS
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

GIMLI
Let’s hope they last the night.

ARAGORN
A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn an

mercy! For you shall receive none!)

GIMLI
What’s
happening out there?

LEGOLAS
Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like
me to find you a box?

GIMLI
Hehehehe!

ARAGORN
Dartho! (Hold!)

THEODEN
So it begins.

ARAGORN
Tangado halad! (Prepare to fire!)

LEGOLAS
Faeg i-varv dîn na lanc a nu ranc. (Their
armor is weak at the neck and beneath
the arms.)

ARAGORN
Leithio i philinn! (Release the arrows!)

GIMLI
Did they hit anything?

THEODEN
Give them a volley.

GAMLING
Fire!

STOP

GIMLI
Legolas, two already!

LEGOLAS
I’m on seventeen!

GIMLI
Argh! I’ll have no pointy-ear
outscoring me!

LEGOLAS
Nineteen!

STOP

PIPPIN
Merry!

TREEBEARD
We have just agreed.

MERRY
Yes?

TREEBEARD
I have told your names to the Ent moot
and we have agreed – you are not Orcs.

PIPPIN
Well, that’s good news.

MERRY
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about HIM?

TREEBEARD
Now don’t be hasty,
Master Meriadoc.

MERRY
Hasty? Our friends are out there! They
need our help! They cannot fight this
war on their own.

TREEBEARD
War, yes. It affects us all. But you
must understand, young hobbit. It takes
a loong time to say anything in ooold -
Entish. And we never say anything -
unless it is worth taking
a looong time to say.

STOP

GIMLI
Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!
Twenty-one! Twenty-two!

ARAGORN
Na fennas! (Causeway!)

THEODEN
Is this it? Is this all you can conjure,
Saruman?

ARAGORN
Togo hon dad, Legolas! (Bring him down,
Legolas!) Dago hon! Dago hon! (Kill him!
Kill him!)

THEODEN
Brace the Gate! Hold them! Stand firm!

GIMLI
Aragorn! Argh!

ARAGORN
Gimli! Hado i philinn! (Hurl the arrows!)

ARAGORN
Herio! (Charge!)

STOP

TREEBEARD
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have
always done.

MERRY
How can that be your decision?!

TREEBEARD
This is not our war.

MERRY
But you're part of this world! Aren’t
you?! You must help, please! You
must do something!

TREEBEARD
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.

PIPPIN
Maybe Treebeard’s right. We don’t belong
here, Merry. It's too big for us. What
can we do in the end? We've got the
Shire. Maybe we should go home.

MERRY
The fires
of Isengard will spread. And the woods
of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

STOP

GAMLING
Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get
your men out of there!

ARAGORN
Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad!
(To the Keep! Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir, to the Keep!)

GIMLI
What are you doing? Argh!
What are you stopping for!

ARAGORN
HALDIR!

STOP

THEODEN
To the gate! Draw
your swords!

GAMLING
Make way! We cannot hold much longer.

ARAGORN
How long do
you need?

THEODEN
As long as you can give me!

THEODEN
Brace the Gate!

GIMLI
Come on! We can take ‘em!

ARAGORN
It’s a long way.

GIMLI
Toss me.

ARAGORN
What?

GIMLI
I cannot jump the distance! You’ll have
to toss me!

GIMLI
Oh! Don’t tell the Elf.

ARAGORN
Not a word.

STOP

THEODEN
Pull everybody back! Pull them back!

THEODEN
They’ve broken through! The castle is
breached. Retreat!

GAMLING
Fall back!

THEODEN
Retreat!

ARAGORN
Hurry! Inside! Get them inside!

GAMLING
Into the Keep!

STOP

TREEBEARD
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest. You can make your way
north to your homeland from there.

PIPPIN
Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take
us south!

TREEBEARD
South? But that will lead you past Isengard.

PIPPIN
Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can
slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer
we are to danger, the farther we are
from harm. It’s the last thing he’ll
expect.

TREEBEARD
Mmmm. That doesn’t make sense to me.
But then, you are very small. Perhaps
you’re right. South it is then. Hold
on, little Shirelings. I always like
going south. Somehow it feels like going
down hill.

MERRY
Are you mad? We’ll be caught!

PIPPIN
No we won’t. Not this time.

STOP

RANGER 1
Look! Osgiliath burns!

RANGER 2
Mordor has come.

FRODO
The Ring will
not save Gondor. It has only the power
to destroy. Please, let me go.

FARAMIR
Hurry.

FRODO
Faramir, you must let me go!

STOP

TREEBEARD
And a little family of field mice that
climb up sometimes and they tickle me
awfully. They’re always trying to get
somewhere where they – Oh!

TREEBEARD
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.

PIPPIN
I’m sorry, Treebeard.

TREEBEARD
They had voices
of their own.
Saruman! A wizard should know better!

TREEBEARD
There is no curse in Elvish, Entish
or the tongues of men for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight.
With rock and stone!

MERRY
Yes!

TREEBEARD
Hoorarooom. Come my friends. The Ents
are going to war. It is likely that
we go to our doom. Last march of the
Ents!

STOP

MADRIL
Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we’ll be overrun.

SAM
Mr Frodo!

FRODO
It’s calling to him, Sam. His eye is
almost on me.

SAM
Hold on, Mr Frodo. You'll be alright.

FARAMIR
Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir
sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will
change our fortunes in this war.

SAM
Do you want to know what happened to
Boromir? You want to know why your brother
died? He tried to take the Ring from
Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect
him, he tried to kill him! The Ring
drove your brother mad!

RANGER
Watch out!

SAM
Mr Frodo?

FRODO
They’re here. They’ve
come.

FARAMIR
NAZGÛL!
Stay here. Keep out of sight. Take cover!

STOP

THEODEN
The fortress is taken. It is over.

ARAGORN
You said this
fortress would never fall while your
men defend it! They still defend it!
They have died defending it!

ARAGORN
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?

GAMLING
There is one passage. It leads into
the mountains. But they will not get
far. The Uruk-hai are too many.

ARAGORN
Send word for the women and children
to make for the mountain pass. And barricade
the entrance.

THEODEN
So much death. What can men do against
such reckless hate?

ARAGORN
Ride out with me. Ride out and
meet them.

THEODEN
For death and glory.

ARAGORN
For Rohan. For your people.

GIMLI
The sun is rising.

GANDALF
Look to my coming at first light on
the fifth day. At dawn, look to the
east.

THEODEN
Yes. Yes! The horn of Helm Hammerhand
shall sound in the deep one last time!

GIMLI
Yes!

THEODEN
Let this be the hour when we draw swords
together. Fell deeds awake. Now for
wrath! Now for ruin! And a red dawn!

THEODEN
FORTH EORLINGAS!

STOP

ARAGORN
Gandalf!

GANDALF
Theoden king stands alone.

EOMER
Not alone. Rohirrim!

THEODEN
Eomer!

EOMER
To the king!

STOP

THEODEN
Victory! We have victory!

STOP

PIPPIN
Yes!

TREEBEARD
A hit. A fine hit!

TREEBEARD
Break the dam! Release the river!

MERRY
Pippin, hold on!

TREEBEARD
Hold on, little hobbits!

STOP

SAM
What are you doing? Where are you going?!

FRODO
Aaarrgghh!

SAM
It’s me. It’s your Sam.
Don’t you know your Sam?

FRODO
I can’t do
this, Sam.

SAM
I know. It’s all wrong. By rights we
shouldn’t even be here. But we are.
It’s like in the great stories, Mr Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn’t want to know the end.
Because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it
was when so much bad had happened?

SAM
But in the end, it’s only a passing
thing, this shadow. Even darkness
must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines
it will shine out the clearer. Those
were the stories that stayed with you.
That meant something, even if you were
too small to understand why. But I think,
Mr Frodo, I do understand. I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances
of turning back only they didn’t. They
kept going because they were holding
on to something.

FRODO
What are we holding on to, Sam?

SAM
There’s some good in this world, Mr
Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for.

FARAMIR
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

MADRIL
You know the laws of our country, the
laws of your father. If you let them
go, your life will be forfeit.

FARAMIR
Then it is forfeit. Release them.

STOP

GANDALF
Sauron’s wrath will be terrible, his
retribution swift. The battle for Helm’s
Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin. All our hopes now
lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere
in the wilderness.

STOP

SAM
I wonder if we’ll ever be put into songs
or tales.

FRODO
What?

SAM
I wonder if people will ever say, ‘let’s
hear about Frodo and the Ring.’ And
they’ll say ‘yes, that’s one of my favorite
stories. Frodo was really courageous,
wasn’t he, dad.’ ‘Yes, my boy, the most
famousest of hobbits. And that’s saying
alot.’

FRODO
Huh, you left out one of the chief characters
– Samwise the Brave. I want to hear
more about Sam.

FRODO
Frodo wouldn’t have got far without
Sam.

SAM
Now Mr Frodo, you shouldn’t make fun.
I was being serious.

FRODO
So was I.

SAM
Samwise the Brave.

FRODO
Smeagol!

SAM
We’re not gonna wait for you. Come on!

SMEAGOL
Master - Master looks after us. Master
wouldn’t hurt us.

GOLLUM
Master broke his promise.

SMEAGOL
Don’t ask Smeagol. Poor, poor Smeagol.

GOLLUM
Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy,
false. We ought to wring his filthy
little neck. Kill him! Kill him! Kill them
both. And then we take the precious
and we be the master.

SMEAGOL
The fat hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.

GOLLUM
Then we stabs them out. Put out his
eyeses. And make HIM crawl.

SMEAGOL
Yes! Yes! Yes!

GOLLUM
Kill them both.

SMEAGOL
Yes! No no!
It’s too risky, it’s too risky.

SAM
Where’s he gone? Hey Gollum, where are
you?

FRODO
Smeagol?

GOLLUM
We could let
HER do it.

SMEAGOL
Yes. She could do it.

GOLLUM
Yes, precious she could. And then we
takes it once they’re dead.

SMEAGOL
Once they’re dead-

GOLLUM
Shh!

SMEAGOL
Come on, hobbits. Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.

GOLLUM
Follow me.
